# CSWomen Travel Grant Program
![WFUM logo](/images/WFUMlogo.png){:style="float: left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;"}
In fall 2016 CSWomen received a $5000 award from [Women for UMass Amherst](http://www.umass.edu/wfum/) organization. With this money we are starting CSWomen Travel Grant program that will allow more women from the College of Information and Computer Sciences to participate in conferences and workshops in the field, engage with their research community earlier, make more professional contacts, and find collaborators for future projects.

If you are a female student at CICS and would like to attend a conference or a workshop, but have no funding available to cover all the costs, you should apply for our grant. We are giving out grants of at most $500 that should be used to help cover travel expenses, hotel accommodations, and registration fees. We review the applications on the first Monday of every month and award 1 or 2 grants each time.

Preference is given to students who have
  - applied for other funding but still have some costs that need to be covered.
  - a paper accepted to the conference/workshop of interest.
  - not attended a conference or workshop in their field, but who are interested in research.

In return we ask you to add acknowledgements of the funding sources and thank Women for UMass and CSWomen organizations in your presentation if you are giving one. You will also be required to write a short blog post about your experience at the conference/workshop that we will publish online.
