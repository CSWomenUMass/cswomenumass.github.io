# CSWomen website information

## Overview

This site was made using Jekyll, specifically with the theme [Mediumish](https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll) (with heavy simplifying modifications).

Here is a brief overview of the parts of this site for users unfamiliar with Jekyll:

### _config.yml

This file contains a lot of general configuration that applies to the website as a whole. Importantly, the list of authors for blogposts is located here. Plugins are declared here, and "collections" which are used for simplifying code elsewhere in the website.

## Add a blog post

### Images

### New authors

## Change officers

## Add a page 


## Contact
 Please contact Neha (nnayak@cs...) if you have any questions about the initial modifications. I will probably have forgotten most of what I did but it's ok! We can work it out together.
