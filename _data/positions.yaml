  - {title: "Connecting the general membership with the resources they need", description: "Members of the CSWomen general membership or outside the community may seek academic, personal, or professional assistance from the co-chairs. Co-chairs should connect members with the appropriate resources, with input from the faculty liaison when in doubt."}
  selection: "Interested parties should submit by email their intent to `womenchairs@cs.umass.edu`, and in the case of multiple applicants, the next co-chair will be decided by a membership vote. Graduate co-chairs may only serve one term."
  term_length: "Graduate co-chairs each serve one term corresponding to one calendar year. Unless a co-chair resigns from their position, terms should be staggered between the two co-chairs. A graduate student may not serve more than one term as a co-chair."

Also tweet professional updates from the membership with the hashtag `#goodnews`. Request the password from the Co-chairs."}
  - {title: "Facebook group membership", description: "The social media chair is responsible for inviting members to the Facebook group and approving individuals who have requested membership. The social media chair should send an email to the general membership publicizing the Facebook group at the beginning of the Fall term. When handling requests to join the group, any 5-College-affiliated individual should be approved. If the social media chair is not sure whether someone has 5-college affiliation, contact that person.
"}
  - {title: "Offline", description: "Although not required, the social media chair is also encouraged to advertise events offline as well. This can be done through postering in the Computer Science building and other appropriate locations. She may work with the [CS Women Graphic Designer](#graphic_designer)."}

  selection: "Interested parties should submit their resumes, social media links, and links to any blog posts to `womenchairs@cs.umass.edu`. Preference will be given to CS Women members who are active in the community and on social media, and especially to those who generate content about women in computing (e.g. those who have active blogs)."
  term_length: "The term for the social media chair is one semester. There are no restrictions on the number of terms served. However, Co-chairs must approve re-appointment."
  time_commitment: "Expect to spend 1-2 hours per week on obligations. Since there are several accounts to manage, we recommend using a dedicated browser to handle all account information. For example, if you typically use Chrome for logging in to your personal accounts, log in to the CS Women accounts using Firefox. This should cut down on the overhead of managing multiple social media accounts."
  notes: "Any interested individual in the general membership is eligible, but preference will be given to graduate women. Note that the CS Women leadership often receives unsolicited recruitment requests. Requests for participation in hackathons are an increasingly popular recruitment mechanism, as are ``free'' schools/camps/etc. CS Women has corporate affiliates via CICS, who are given priority in recruitment. Any requests from parties that are not affiliates need to be redirected to the Treasurer, who will put them in touch with the appropriate liaison in CICS."
