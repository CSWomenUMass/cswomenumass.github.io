### CS Women Awarded Spring 2015 NCWIT Student Seed Funding
CS Women is thrilled to announce that we've been awarded [NCWIT Student Seed Funding, sponsored by Symantec](https://www.ncwit.org/programs-campaigns/ncwit-awards/ncwit-student-seed-fund)! 

This funding will support a series of technical workshops designed to build every day skills that students who are introduced to computer science in an academic setting often lack. The workshops will be taught by Computer Science graduate students (and some exceptional undergraduates) of all genders. We aspire to have gender parity in our workshop instructors. Our initial cohort of instructors will have the opportunity to develop a curriculum for a diverse audience; we believe this opportunity presents an attractive supplement or alternative to teaching assistantships for students who want to become teachers. 

We intend to promote a collaborative atmosphere where attendees feel comfortable taking risks. Our target level of technological literacy is that of a first-year graduate student. However, we invite all students in the Five College Consortium to attend. We intend to make our teaching resources publicly available and encourage those who have reached proficiency to lead future workshops. 

If you are interested in getting involved, email womenchairs@cs.umass.edu.
