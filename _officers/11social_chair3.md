I am a second year Master's Student and my area of interest is Machine Learning and its applications. I enjoy working on projects that span vision and natural language tasks. I also have a keen interest in using machine learning to solve problems in the medical domain.
While I am not working, I enjoy playing basketball and painting. You can reach me at akamath@cs.umass.edu.
