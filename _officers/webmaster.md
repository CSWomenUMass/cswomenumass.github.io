I am a 2nd year Masters student currently working with Professor Prashant Shenoy on IoT for Water Quality Monitering and a mHealth Project with Prof. Deepak Ganesan. I have previously worked with Prof. Eliot Moss on JVM Bytecode Optimization. My research interests involve wearables and health sensing.

Apart from being a grad student and Webmaster for CS Women, I am also the President of the Indian Student Association at UMass Amherst. To know more about me, you can visit my personal website at http://ishitadasgupta.weebly.com/
