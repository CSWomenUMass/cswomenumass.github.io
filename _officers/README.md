# CS Women Officers

To modify officers, you can either fork the repository and set up in the same way as instructed in the blog README file. But make sure that you fork the entire repository rather than just only the blog branch (otherwise pulling from upstream would be a problem). The best way to do it is to obtain admin permission first. The rest of the README is based on the assumption that the user can freely change and this repository.

## Modify an Officer's Information

Go to `_officers` folder, find the officer's `.md` file which you want to update and change according to the original format. To update a thumbnail picture, change the pictures at `assets/images/officers`.

## Add a New Officer

If you are creating a new position, add a new `.md` file. Copy the format from the other files and add the information accordingly. If the position exists, please refer to the previous section. Make sure the picture names make sense and you clean up unused pictures.
