I am a second year Master's Student interested in Distributed Systems, Databases and Machine Learning. I am excited to be part of the CSWomen committee and hope to plan some fun events along with the other Social Co-chairs this year. In my free time, I enjoy reading novels, traveling and sampling new cuisines.

Feel free to contact me at asuraj@cs.umass.edu.
