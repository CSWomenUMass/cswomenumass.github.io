In the last week of June 2019, I had the opportunity to present two of my projects, titled “iLid: eyewear solution for low-power fatigue and drowsiness monitoring” and “W!NCE: eyewear solution for upper face action units monitoring”, at the ACM symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications (ETRA) in Denver, Colorado. During the poster fast forward session, I gave a small introductory talk for each of the projects and then during the poster session, I introduced my proposed work in details and showed demo videos. This gave me the opportunity to discuss my projects with many people and got a lot of valuable feedback.

The interesting part of this conference was the diverse attendees and companies who gathered from all around the world: Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Austria, UK, Canada, States, Japan, China, and etc. The environment of the conference was also very dynamic and energetic as each of these popular eye tracking companies had their own stations, and attendees could freely test their newest devices and talk with them about state-of-the-art products. This vibrant connection between academia and industry was really unique, fun to participate, and educative.

I am really grateful to the CSWomen group for providing the financial support. It helped me cover some of the expenses to participate in this great event.
