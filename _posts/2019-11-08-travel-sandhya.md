In November 2019, I had the opportunity to present my work and attend the Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) conference at Macau, China. The conference is a great opportunity to meet researchers from various sub-fields of AI and robotics. Thanks to the support of CS Women travel grant, I was able to travel to Macau to present my paper.

The conference was a 5-day event and the attendees were a mix of students, professors, and researchers from the industry. It turned out to be a wonderful experience for me to meet my research community from around the world and share ideas. I was also able to attend several talks and workshop sessions that were part of the conference. It was interesting to hear from many different perspectives and I was able to learn a lot from the speakers at the sessions of workshop and the conference, and from conversations with
the other attendees.

Overall, the event was enjoyable and beneficial to me. I am thankful to CSWomen group for providing their generous financial support. It helped cover some of the travel expenses to attend this wonderful event!
