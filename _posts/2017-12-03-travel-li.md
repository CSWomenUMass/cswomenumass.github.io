>In early November, I went to attend AMIA (American Medical Informatics Association) 2017 Annual Symposium at Washington D.C. The conference is about informatics for improving health and making better healthcare decisions, basically in five domains of informatics: translational bioinformatics, clinical research informatics, clinical informatics, consumer health informatics, and public health informatics. I went to present my paper of using natural language processing method for data mining in Electronic Health Records. I am very happy that people showed interest on my work and asked me questions, and I also got valuable insights from them for future work.

Besides the keynote presentations, various talks, poster sessions and workshops, AMIA also offers rich networking opportunities, like AMIA New Member and First Time Attendee Reception, Women in AMIA Networking Event, AMIA dancing party etc. It’s great to talk with researchers working in different aspects of medical informatics and to learn from them.

In general, it’s a wonderful and very rewarding experience for me. I am very thankful to [Women for UMass Amherst](http://www.umass.edu/wfum/) and [CSWomen group](http://cswomenumass.github.io/index.html) for providing the generous financial support, which help covered part of the travel expenses.
