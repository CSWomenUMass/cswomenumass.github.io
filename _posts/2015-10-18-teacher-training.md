On Sunday 9/27 and Monday 9/28, CS Women hosted our first-ever teacher training workshop and retreat for the volunteers who will be leading [Symantec-funded technical skills workshops](https://www.ncwit.org/programs-campaigns/ncwit-awards/ncwit-student-seed-fund/previous-ncwit-student-seed-fund-winners) throughout the rest of the semester.

On Sunday, [Apoorva Balevalachilu](http://apoorvaraob.wix.com/about-me/), [John Foley](jjfiv.githib.io), [Tian Guo](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~tian), [Cibele Freire](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~cibelemf), [Shamya Karumbaiah](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~shamya), [Anupama Pasumarthy](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~apasumarthy), [Emma Strubell](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~strubell), and [Emma Tosch](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~etosch) gathered to put together the cirriculum for the semester. [Ari Kobren](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~akobren) and [Pat Verga](http://people.cs.umass.edu/~pat/) were unable to attend, but will be participating as well. Topics for this semester include git, LatTeX, basic and intermediate bash skills, Unix, and possibly some advanced/fun topics like graphing (matplotlib, R, d3), using the Twitter API, and others. 

On Monday, the team headed to [Mt. Holyoke's Willits-Hallowell Center](https://www.mtholyoke.edu/willits/) for active learning training with [Rachel Rybaczuk](https://twitter.com/rachel_rybaczuk), and a retreat on the college's beautiful campus:
