Thanks to the support of [Women for UMass Amherst](http://www.umass.edu/wfum/), we have awarded another [Travel Grant](http://cswomenumass.github.io/travelgrant.html)! Sou Young received $500 to cover the costs of her visit to [IEEE's computer vision and pattern recognition conference](http://cvpr2017.thecvf.com/). Below is her impression of the event.

>Hawaii is a really great place for summer vacation, but I have experienced something different this summer by attending a conference there! It is IEEE/CVF computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR) which is one of the top-tier conferences in the computer vision community. Thanks to CS Women, I could attend this year's CVPR and present my workshop paper at [Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC)](https://sites.google.com/view/fgvc4/home). My work is to group faces in a movie without any supervision, which can cluster the same person with a unique ID. In the poster session, I introduced my proposed work and showed a demo video. I discussed my work with many people and got a lot of valuable comments. <br/><br/>

During the main conference, as there are enormous amount of papers, I had to use my time efficiently. So, everyday I woke up in the morning, I went through all the papers in the list and read some abstracts to check which oral/poster presentations I would like to visit. Then, I read the papers more deeply or visited the corresponding posters to talk with authors at the spot, which is the best part of attending a conference!! <br/><br/>
This CVPR had around 200 sponsors from industry, and there were many interesting exhibition booths. Here is a photo of me enjoying the real-time style-transfer demo from NVIDIA. <br/><br/>

In addition to the exhibitions, some companies also held interesting after-dinner events, and I could have good discussions on my research with people who are currently working on the companies. In this CVPR, I have learned a lot and had invaluable experience in my life. I really appreciate of UMass CS Women’s help in giving me the financial support for the conference registration! :) <br/><br/>
