With the semester fast coming to an end, we want to announce the topic of our last technical workshop of the semester: Advanced Git, lead by [Bobby Powers](http://cs.umass.edu/~bpowers). Bobby volunteered after attending [Cibele Freire's](http://cs.umass.edu/~cibelemf) LaTeX workshop. The workshop will take place on Tuesday, December 1.

We'd like to thank our dedicated teachers for the following workshops:

[Shamya Karumbaiah](http://cics.umass.edu/~shamya) | [Git](http://github.com/CSWomenUMass/git)
[Tian Guo](http://cics.umass.edu/~tian) | [UNIX basics](http://github.com/CSWomenUMass/unix)
[Cibele Freire](http://cics.umass.edu/~cibelemf) | [LaTeX](http://github.com/CSWomenUMass/latex)
[Apoorva Balevalachilu](http://cics.umass.edu/~arb) | [Bash One-Liners](http://github.com/CSWomenUMass/bash-one-liners)

We'd also like to thank the rest of the team for their tactical support throughout the program. Although there was a single teacher at the front of the classroom, we developed materials as a team, and provided teaching support during the workshops. The camaraderie amongst teachers and subsequent support they provided to the students was better than we'd imagined! Our teachers were a mix of male and female graduate students, and the attendees were both male and female undergraduate and graduate students. The proportion of women in attendence was consistently over 50%!
