For the second year in a row, we ran a very successful Ice Cream Social! This year it was on Friday, September 18th. 34 members attended in total, with 19 graduate students, 13 undergraduate students, one staff member, and one faculty member. A variety of cold desserts were served.

We also used this event to introduce our newest CS Women Co-Chairs: [Emma Strubell](https://people.cs.umass.edu/~strubell/) and [Supriya Kankure](https://www.facebook.com/supriya.kankure). Emma and Supriya will serve two-semester terms, from Fall 2015--Spring 2015. Other general announcements included our status on becoming a Graduate Student Organization. As of today, [we have been accepted as a GSO](https://umassamherst.collegiatelink.net/organization/gradwomencompsci) (1). However, we are still working on the organizational structure. If you have any suggestions, please take a look at [our constitution on GitHub](https://github.com/CSWomenUMass/gso) and leave comments there!

Unfortunately, we were not able to get pictures this year! If you attended and have pictures to send us, to attach to this post, please contact one of our Social Media Chairs: [Nabanita De](nabanita@cs.umass.edu) or [Diane Tam](http://dztam@umass.edu/).

(1) Note: There seems to have been a clerical error in the processing of our organization's name -- we are currently working to remove "Graduate" from the group name, since this group is open to all affiliates of CICS.
