# Queripidia - Query-specific Wikipedia Construction
Abstract: We all turn towards Wikipedia with questions we want to know more about, but eventually find ourselves on the limit of its coverage. Instead of providing "ten blue links", my goal is to answer any web query with something that looks and feels like Wikipedia. I am developing algorithms to automatically retrieve, extract, and compile a knowledge resource for a given web query. For a very early web demo with some example queries see: http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/~dietz/queripidia/

# Build a Shrine to Yourself
Abstract: Am I good enough? Is this the right topic? Am I in the right place? Am I passionate enough? If I switch now, will my career be over? - I have a lot of self doubts. I went through several advisors, topics, and research labs before I graduated age 34. Maybe I did everything wrong. Yet, some people believe that I am a successful researcher. How did I trick people? This is a talk about how to build a shrine to yourself.
