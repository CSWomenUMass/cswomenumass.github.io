Hi CSWomen, 

Our CSWomen group has had quite the exciting semester! First, I want to extend a big thank-you to all our officers who have put in a lot of time and effort to make our CSWomen events possible. 

This semester, we organized community-building social events, partnered with other groups who brought prominent women in computer science to speak at UMass, and funded women to attend conferences with our travel grant. Hereâ€™s a recap of our activities this semester: 

**Speaker Events**  

- Hema Raghavan, Director of Engineering at LinkedIn (9/20)  
- Ayanna Howard, Mark C. Smith Professor and Chair of the School of Interactive Computing in the College of Computing at Georgia Tech (10/7)  
- Graduate Student Panel (12/3)  

**Career Events**  

- Google Resume Workshop (9/20)  

**Social Events**
  
- Semester welcome and board games lunch (9/11)  
- Weekly Tuesday Teas  
- Mt. Norwottuck Hike (10/4)  
- Halloween Tea (10/31)  

**Travel Grant**  

- Funded travel grants to 12 women in 2019 (9 for students presenting research papers, 1 to a summer school, and 2 special interest summits).  

We hope you will continue to attend our events next semester to strengthen and grow our community of graduate women here at UMass! 

Best, 
Katie
