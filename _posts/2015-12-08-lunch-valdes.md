Our third speaker of the semester was [Consuelo Valdes](http://consuelovaldes.com/), who traveled from the Boston area to tell us about her experiences as a UX researcher and designer. 21 members attended: 5 undergraduate students and 16 graduate students. Here are the abstracts for her talk:

## HCI/UX: Museum to Malware
HCI and UX are two sides of the same coin, differentiated only by nomenclature and stakeholders. In the five years since I received my undergrad degree, it has been my pleasure to experience both perspectives. During this talk, I will present my HCI research with next-gen interfaces and selected UX designs from my time in the industry. I will discuss the challenges experienced within each project as a researcher and designer.

## On the Importance of Soft Skills
Every opportunity I have had in my life, I can trace back to the personal connections I have made and the way that I approach my work. I was not a straight A student in undergrad; despite that I have 14 publications under my belt and several presentations at prestigious conferences in HCI and UX. Every position I have left, has been an amicable and bittersweet experience where I would be welcomed to return with open arms. In this talk, I will discuss the skills that have helped me to succeed, despite what my report card said.
