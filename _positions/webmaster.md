Isn't this site cool? @etosch and @strubell wrote it in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/), and some [Javascript](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.M0fbf1927fd34e2741dae186affcf8410H0&pid=15.1), with layout and css classiness from [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and some of their own hacking (enabled by [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)). It doesn't require any special editors, and all the related software is available for free online.

Maintaining the CS Women website is a great way to get some front-end experience, to learn the kinds of technologies and real-world skills that are useful on the job market, and to learn a little about organizing real-world software.
