_This position was formerly known as Social Media Chair_.

The role of the public relations chair is to publicize events and news related to CS Women on public websites, Twitter, and the blog. A more detailed explanation of the Public Relations Chair's duties is available in the [constitution](https://github.com/CSWomenUMass/gso/blob/master/constitution/positions/socialmedia_main.pdf).

# Responsibilities
The social media chair should maintain an active presence on the following outlets:

* _Blog posts_. The primary externally-facing public relations resource is the CS Women website. Our front page is the blog -- this shows our activity and is critical for recruiting and for obtaining funding. The Public Relations chair is not required to generate content for the post, but instead to edit Scribe notes, personal statements, and other content solicited from the membership.

* _Github_. All CS Women documentation is kept on Github. The social media chair will be tagged in relevant posts.

* _Twitter_. CS Women maintains a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/cswomenumass) that should be used for group news. Re-tweet relevant news from the CICS account. The Twitter account is more actively followed by professional organizations and corporate affiliates. Tweet corporate-sponsored events with the sponsor's hashtag(s). Also tweet professional updates from the membership with the hashtag `#goodnews`. Request the password from the Co-chairs.

* _Facebook group membership_. The social media chair is responsible for inviting members to the Facebook group and approving individuals who have requested membership. The social media chair should send an email to the general membership publicizing the Facebook group at the beginning of the Fall term. When handling requests to join the group, any 5-College-affiliated individual should be approved. If the social media chair is not sure whether someone has 5-college affiliation, contact that person.

* _Facebook posts_. CS Women maintains a closed Facebook group, where students post articles of interest and events. The social media chair should publicize events here. Request administrative access from the current Co-chairs. Since members are typically emailed when there are activities, this is the lowest priority responsibility and should mainly be used to advertise activities that are open to female-identified students from the greater 5-college community.

Although not required, the social media chair is also encouraged to advertise events offline as well. This can be done through postering in the Computer Science building and other appropriate locations. She may work with the [CS Women Graphic Designer](#graphic_designer).

Note that the CS Women leadership often receives unsolicited recruitment requests. Requests for participation in hackathons are an increasingly popular recruitment mechanism, as are ``free'' schools/camps/etc. CS Women has corporate affiliates via CICS, who are given priority in recruitment. Any requests from parties that are not affiliates need to be redirected to the Treasurer, who will put them in touch with the appropriate liaison in CICS.


# Selection
Interested parties should submit their resumes, social media links, and links to any blog posts to `womenchairs@cs.umass.edu`. Preference will be given to CS Women members who are active in the community and on social media, and especially to those who generate content about women in computing (e.g. those who have active blogs).

# Term Length
The term for the social media chair is one semester. There are no restrictions on the number of terms served. However, Co-chairs must approve re-appointment.

# Estimated Time Commitment
Expect to spend 1-2 hours per week on obligations. Since there are several accounts to manage, we recommend using a dedicated browser to handle all account information. For example, if you typically use Chrome for logging in to your personal accounts, log in to the CS Women accounts using Firefox. This should cut down on the overhead of managing multiple social media accounts.

# Additional Eligibility Notes and Requirements
Any interested individual in the general membership is eligible, but preference will be given to graduate women.
