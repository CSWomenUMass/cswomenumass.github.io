Do you love participating in CS Women activities, but have no time for extra responsibilities? Apply to be a CS Women event photographer.

# Responsibilities
The CS Women photographer should be available to attend most extra-curricular CS Women activities, and should let the Co-chairs know in advance if she cannot. These include the social events, workshops, and networking events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration. Since the lunches are closed events, we do not typically take photographs.

# Selection
Interested applicants should submit their names and any relevant portfolio work (not required) to `womenchairs@cs.umass.edu`. Co-chairs will select from the pool of applicants. Students do not need to own a camera; high-quality cameras may be borrowed from the university. 

# Term Length
Term length is one semester and is renewable without re-application, pending approval of the Co-chairs.

# Estimated Time Commitment
The time commitment depends on the number of non-lunch events each semester. If there is sufficient interest, we may select more than one photographer, which will reduce the time commitment per person.

# Additional Eligibility Notes and Requirements
This position is open to all CS Women members. Individuals who are not female-identified, but who have an interest in CS Women may also apply. _We especially encourage undergraduates to apply for this position_.
