Two graduate and two undergraduate co-chairs provide executive leadership and are the primary points of contact for the CSWomen membership. 

# Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the co-chairs include but are not limited to:

* __Organizing the monthly lunches__. The scheduling, format, content, and duration of the monthly lunches is determined primarily by the graduate co-chairs, with input from the undergraduate co-chairs when appropriate.

* __Organizing other social and professional events__. Co-chairs help organize and facilitate events to provide networking opportunities for the women in the college.  

* __Representing the organization at public events, upon request__. Co-chairs may be asked to speak on behalf of the CSWomen organization, or as representatives of women's interests in the CICS.

* __Connecting the general membership with the resources they need__. Members of the CSWomen general membership or outside the community may seek academic, personal, or professional assistance from the co-chairs. Co-chairs should connect members with the appropriate resources, with input from the faculty liaison when in doubt.

* __Selecting new co-chairs and reviewing applications for other positions__.

* __Graduate co-chairs should take on the responsibilities of the non-essential positions when those positions are not filled.__ These responsibilities may include web-master, social chair, social media/PR, etc.

# Selection
Interested parties should submit by email their intent to `womenchairs@cs.umass.edu`, and in the case of multiple applicants, the next co-chair will be decided by a membership vote. Graduate co-chairs may only serve one term.

# Term Length
Graduate co-chairs each serve one term corresponding to one calendar year. Unless a co-chair resigns from their position, terms should be staggered between the two co-chairs. A graduate student may not serve more than one term as a co-chair.

# Estimated Time Commitment
CSWomen co-chairs can be a significant time commitment. Other departmental service is highly discouraged during co-chair term. Expect to spend 5-7 hrs per week on CSWomen responsibilities. Expect to spend fewer hours when non-essential positions are filled.

# Additional Eligibility Notes and Requirements
Graduate co-chairs must be enrolled in a graduate degree program in CICS.
