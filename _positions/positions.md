---
Two graduate and two undergraduate co-chairs provide executive leadership and are the primary points of contact for the CSWomen membership. 

# Responsibilities
The responsibilities of the co-chairs include but are not limited to:

* __Organizing the monthly lunches__. The scheduling, format, content, and duration of the monthly lunches is determined primarily by the graduate co-chairs, with input from the undergraduate co-chairs when appropriate.

* __Organizing other social and professional events__. Co-chairs help organize and facilitate events to provide networking opportunities for the women in the college.  

* __Representing the organization at public events, upon request__. Co-chairs may be asked to speak on behalf of the CSWomen organization, or as representatives of women's interests in the CICS.

* __Connecting the general membership with the resources they need__. Members of the CSWomen general membership or outside the community may seek academic, personal, or professional assistance from the co-chairs. Co-chairs should connect members with the appropriate resources, with input from the faculty liaison when in doubt.

* __Selecting new co-chairs and reviewing applications for other positions__.

* __Graduate co-chairs should take on the responsibilities of the non-essential positions when those positions are not filled.__ These responsibilities may include web-master, social chair, social media/PR, etc.

# Selection
Interested parties should submit by email their intent to `womenchairs@cs.umass.edu`, and in the case of multiple applicants, the next co-chair will be decided by a membership vote. Graduate co-chairs may only serve one term.

# Term Length
Graduate co-chairs each serve one term corresponding to one calendar year. Unless a co-chair resigns from their position, terms should be staggered between the two co-chairs. A graduate student may not serve more than one term as a co-chair.

# Estimated Time Commitment
CSWomen co-chairs can be a significant time commitment. Other departmental service is highly discouraged during co-chair term. Expect to spend 5-7 hrs per week on CSWomen responsibilities. Expect to spend fewer hours when non-essential positions are filled.

# Additional Eligibility Notes and Requirements
Graduate co-chairs must be enrolled in a graduate degree program in CICS.

Do you love participating in CS Women activities, but have no time for extra responsibilities? Apply to be a CS Women event photographer.

# Responsibilities
The CS Women photographer should be available to attend most extra-curricular CS Women activities, and should let the Co-chairs know in advance if she cannot. These include the social events, workshops, and networking events such as the Grace Hopper Celebration. Since the lunches are closed events, we do not typically take photographs.

# Selection
Interested applicants should submit their names and any relevant portfolio work (not required) to `womenchairs@cs.umass.edu`. Co-chairs will select from the pool of applicants. Students do not need to own a camera; high-quality cameras may be borrowed from the university. 

# Term Length
Term length is one semester and is renewable without re-application, pending approval of the Co-chairs.

# Estimated Time Commitment
The time commitment depends on the number of non-lunch events each semester. If there is sufficient interest, we may select more than one photographer, which will reduce the time commitment per person.

# Additional Eligibility Notes and Requirements
This position is open to all CS Women members. Individuals who are not female-identified, but who have an interest in CS Women may also apply. _We especially encourage undergraduates to apply for this position_.

pos_id: pr_chair

_This position was formerly known as Social Media Chair_.

The role of the public relations chair is to publicize events and news related to CS Women on public websites, Twitter, and the blog. A more detailed explanation of the Public Relations Chair's duties is available in the [constitution](https://github.com/CSWomenUMass/gso/blob/master/constitution/positions/socialmedia_main.pdf).

# Responsibilities
The social media chair should maintain an active presence on the following outlets:

* _Blog posts_. The primary externally-facing public relations resource is the CS Women website. Our front page is the blog -- this shows our activity and is critical for recruiting and for obtaining funding. The Public Relations chair is not required to generate content for the post, but instead to edit Scribe notes, personal statements, and other content solicited from the membership.

* _Github_. All CS Women documentation is kept on Github. The social media chair will be tagged in relevant posts.

* _Twitter_. CS Women maintains a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/cswomenumass) that should be used for group news. Re-tweet relevant news from the CICS account. The Twitter account is more actively followed by professional organizations and corporate affiliates. Tweet corporate-sponsored events with the sponsor's hashtag(s). Also tweet professional updates from the membership with the hashtag `#goodnews`. Request the password from the Co-chairs.

* _Facebook group membership_. The social media chair is responsible for inviting members to the Facebook group and approving individuals who have requested membership. The social media chair should send an email to the general membership publicizing the Facebook group at the beginning of the Fall term. When handling requests to join the group, any 5-College-affiliated individual should be approved. If the social media chair is not sure whether someone has 5-college affiliation, contact that person.

* _Facebook posts_. CS Women maintains a closed Facebook group, where students post articles of interest and events. The social media chair should publicize events here. Request administrative access from the current Co-chairs. Since members are typically emailed when there are activities, this is the lowest priority responsibility and should mainly be used to advertise activities that are open to female-identified students from the greater 5-college community.

Although not required, the social media chair is also encouraged to advertise events offline as well. This can be done through postering in the Computer Science building and other appropriate locations. She may work with the [CS Women Graphic Designer](#graphic_designer).

Note that the CS Women leadership often receives unsolicited recruitment requests. Requests for participation in hackathons are an increasingly popular recruitment mechanism, as are ``free'' schools/camps/etc. CS Women has corporate affiliates via CICS, who are given priority in recruitment. Any requests from parties that are not affiliates need to be redirected to the Treasurer, who will put them in touch with the appropriate liaison in CICS.


# Selection
Interested parties should submit their resumes, social media links, and links to any blog posts to `womenchairs@cs.umass.edu`. Preference will be given to CS Women members who are active in the community and on social media, and especially to those who generate content about women in computing (e.g. those who have active blogs).

# Term Length
The term for the social media chair is one semester. There are no restrictions on the number of terms served. However, Co-chairs must approve re-appointment.

# Estimated Time Commitment
Expect to spend 1-2 hours per week on obligations. Since there are several accounts to manage, we recommend using a dedicated browser to handle all account information. For example, if you typically use Chrome for logging in to your personal accounts, log in to the CS Women accounts using Firefox. This should cut down on the overhead of managing multiple social media accounts.

# Additional Eligibility Notes and Requirements
Any interested individual in the general membership is eligible, but preference will be given to graduate women.

Isn't this site cool? @etosch and @strubell wrote it in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [Liquid](http://liquidmarkup.org/), and some [Javascript](https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.M0fbf1927fd34e2741dae186affcf8410H0&pid=15.1), with layout and css classiness from [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and some of their own hacking (enabled by [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)). It doesn't require any special editors, and all the related software is available for free online.

Maintaining the CS Women website is a great way to get some front-end experience, to learn the kinds of technologies and real-world skills that are useful on the job market, and to learn a little about organizing real-world software.

# Responsibilities

* Respond to urgent and minor edits on the website, using Github issues.
* Update the website in concert with the Co-chairs.
* Chief maintainer for the blog. (This means you must collect and post notes from the [Scribe](#scribe)).

# Selection
Although we will give preference to individuals with experience, the position is open to anyone who is interested in learning the skills necessary to fulfill the above stated responsibilities. Please submit the following to `womenchairs@cs.umass.edu`:

* A short paragraph stating your interest.
* Your relationship with CICS.
* Your GitHub handle
* Links to any prior websites you have maintained or contributed to.

# Term Length
Two semesters, renewable once.

# Estimated Time Commitment
Barring any major revisions to the website, at most one hour per week. However, for students not already proficient in the skills, we strongly encourage that they set up their own website to help learn the technologies. The amount of time this requires will vary with the individual.

# Additional Eligibility Notes and Requirements
We require that the webmaster be female-identified. _We strongly encourage undergraduates to apply for this position._
