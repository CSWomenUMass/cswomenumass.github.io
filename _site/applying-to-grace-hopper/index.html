				<p>One of our members, Shiri Dori-Hacohen, has been successful in being awarded the Grace Hopper scholarship to attend GHC multiple times in the past. As a result, she often fields questions about the admissions process. This year, she has taken the time to compile them into a list of “frequently-asked-questions” for members working on their application or attending for the first time.</p>

<div class="document-quote">
  <p>On top of the GHC16 scholarship applications, there is also a call for proposals with the same deadline (March 30th). Proposals include panels, talks and posters. From my experience, people with accepted posters often have a higher chance of getting scholarships. There are technical and non-technical tracks.</p>

  <p>http://ghc.anitaborg.org/2016-speakers/</p>

  <p>This is a very cool opportunity if you’re interested in public speaking or presenting your research in a non-traditional setting. (If the latter is your goal, be mindful that this is not considered a technical publication and should probably not be used to communicate otherwise unpublished research. If in doubt, consult with your advisor).</p>

  <p>Also as an added perk, accepted talks (but not posters) are getting a complimentary registration for the day of your talk, or a discount if attending the entire conference.</p>

  <p>I’m passing this along with a blog post with tips on how to maximize your chances for a proposal to be accepted:</p>

  <p>Best of luck to all,
Shiri</p>

<p><a href="http://ghc.anitaborg.org/sign-up-for-our-newsletter/">Sign up for their newsletter</a> or follow them on your favorite social media (<a href="http://ghc.anitaborg.org/">look for icons on the top &amp; bottom</a>)</p>

<h2 id="general-application-questions">General Application Questions</h2>

<h3 id="i-am-a-first-year-graduate-student-at-umass-computer-science-i-want-to-apply-for-grace-hopper-scholarship-what-is-your-advice">I am a first year graduate student at UMass Computer Science. I want to apply for Grace-hopper scholarship, what is your advice?</h3>
<p>My biggest piece of advice would be to submit a poster in addition to the scholarship application. Getting a poster presentation accepted is correlated with scholarships.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-reimbursement-work">How does reimbursement work?</h3>
<p>You get reimbursed later.</p>

<h3 id="do-i-need-a-travel-authorization">Do I need a travel authorization?</h3>
<p>Yes, you must fill out a Travel Authorization form, which lays out your expected travel, housing, and meal expenses for UMass ahead of time.</p>

<h3 id="if-i-get-accepted-what-about-registration">If I get accepted, what about registration?</h3>
<p>This varies from year to year, but often runs out early. Keep an eye out for announcements.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-other-funding-sources">What about other funding sources?</h3>
<p>Google scholarships or other sources have been available in the past. You’ll have to see what becomes available this year. GHC should know about it; keep an eye out.</p>

<h3 id="i-missed-the-deadline-what-can-i-do">I missed the deadline, what can I do?</h3>
<p><em>There’s always next year</em>. If you’re an early-stage grad student, you will also be eligible for Grad Cohort, so keeep your eyes open for emails about that as well.</p>

<h3 id="is-it-a-good-idea-to-bring-my-husbandspousesignificant-other-with-me">Is it a good idea to bring my husband/spouse/significant other with me?</h3>
<p>While family travel is not likely to be supported through grants, your family is certainly welcome at the conference. I (Shiri) have attended with a baby and a husband, but it’s your personal choice.</p>

<h3 id="what-about-childcare">What about childcare?</h3>
<p>There is usually free childcare, but you have to sign up in advance. If you then don’t attend the conference, they will charge you money anyway.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-the-deadlines">What are the deadlines?</h3>
<p>The <a href="http://ghc.anitaborg.org/">website</a> is the one true source.</p>

<h3 id="should-i-also-apply-to-the-department-gch-award">Should I also apply to the department GCH award?</h3>
<p>Yes. You definitely should apply once details are out. If you’re not sure if they’re out, ask our Khaleesi, <a href="mailto:leclerc@cs.umass.edu">Leeanne</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-should-i-write-my-essay-about">What should I write my essay about?</h3>
<p>The topic might change from year to year, <em>but</em> assuming it stays similar to prior years, there are some general pointers. Typically, they ask “Why do you want to come, and how will you share back with your community?”</p>

<p>You should:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Focus on topics like your specific challenges.</li>
  <li>Answer how attending GHC will help you, specifically.</li>
  <li>Answer how you’ll share what you learn back to the CS women community (You can always write a blog post!).</li>
  <li>Make it personal, use stories from your life.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-do-i-get-someone-to-proofread-my-essay">How do I get someone to proofread my essay?</h3>

<p>If you have time, it’s best to get someone else to read and review your essay (preferably a native English speaker, if possible). Sign in to <a href="https://cswomen.slack.com">cswomen.slack.com</a> and ask for feedback!</p>

<h2 id="student-research-competition-authorship">Student Research Competition Authorship</h2>

<h3 id="there-appears-to-be-a-department-limit-for-the-number-of-submissions-that-can-be-sent-from-each-department-ghc-recommends-coordinating-with-your-chair">There appears to be a department limit for the number of submissions that can be sent from each department. GHC recommends coordinating with your chair.</h3>

<p>This doesn’t appear to be relevant to our current year, or they’ve removed the submission page. Either way, our current chair is <a href="mailto:allan@cs.umass.edu">James Allan</a>, who would coordinate submissions. In the future, if you want to apply to this, and you don’t know who the chair is, you can always email <a href="mailto:womenchairs@cs.umass.edu">womenchairs@cs.umass.edu</a>, and someone will help you.</p>

<h3 id="i-cant-submit-to-this-because-i-always-work-with-my-advisor-right">I can’t submit to this because I always work with my advisor, right?</h3>

<p>As long as work is done primarily by you, it can be submitted. What this means is dependent. If you’re not sure, ask your advisor. <strong><em>You should check with your advisor about submitting any of this work, anyway.</em></strong></p>
