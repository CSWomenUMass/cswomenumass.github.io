    "body": "UMass Amherst CS Women was founded almost 25 years by Professor Lori Clarke as a community to support and serve women faculty and graduate students. Since its beginning, the group’s vibrant leadership has been spearheaded by graduate women addressing the changing needs of our community. Today we serve almost a hundred graduate women. Our membership has expanded to include female undergraduate computer science majors from the five colleges, as well as advocates of any gender who promote the interests of women in computing. Our focus is on community building. We work closely with the faculty and staff of the College of Information and Computer Sciences to provide programs and services for our female-identified students. We also organize social events, lectures, and other professional activities that are open to all students in the College of Information and Computer Sciences. Two graduate women students, often joined by two undergraduate women, serve as co-chairs for 2-semester terms. If you would like to get involved, email us at womenchairs@cs. umass. edu. "

    "body": "2017/09/28 -   As my summer of 2017 came to a close, I had the fortune of attending a week-long summer school program on Cognitive Architectures at Universität Bielefeld Cluster of Excellence Cognitive Interaction Technology (CITEC) in Germany. Days were filled with keynote talks on cognitive architectures geared towards applications in robotics from senior researchers who are well-known in their research areas. In the afternoon, we split into subgroups where each group was assigned a robotic platform and a task to complete by the end of the week. I was assigned to Pepper, a humanoid robot from SoftBank Robotics, with the task of having it learn how to play the cup-and-ball game. While the task was rather disconnected from the cognitive architecture theme we saw during the keynote talks, it was still fun and interesting to work with a different robotic platform than what I normally use in my lab.  The best part of this whole experience was the unique networking opportunity. CITEC Summer School drew in around 30 young researchers from not only robotics, but also psychology, biology, linguistics, and other subfields of computer science. The majority of the participants were from European research institutions (I was the only from the U. S. ). As such I was able to discuss my research interest and bounce ideas off of people both inside and outside the robotics community as well as promote the ongoing work of the robotics community at UMass Amherst. The relatively small and diverse attendance was definitely unique to the summer school and something you would not normally get to experience from larger, more field-targeted conferences. Thank you so much Women for UMass Amherst and CS Women for providing the financial support to subsidize a portion of this trip! "

Hawaii is a really great place for summer vacation, but I have experienced something different this summer by attending a conference there! It is IEEE/CVF computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR) which is one of the top-tier conferences in the computer vision community. Thanks to CS Women, I could attend this year’s CVPR and present my workshop paper at Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC). My work is to group faces in a movie without any supervision, which can cluster the same person with a unique ID. In the poster session, I introduced my proposed work and showed a demo video. I discussed my work with many people and got a lot of valuable comments.  During the main conference, as there are enormous amount of papers, I had to use my time efficiently. So, everyday I woke up in the morning, I went through all the papers in the list and read some abstracts to check which oral/poster presentations I would like to visit. Then, I read the papers more deeply or visited the corresponding posters to talk with authors at the spot, which is the best part of attending a conference!! This CVPR had around 200 sponsors from industry, and there were many interesting exhibition booths. Here is a photo of me enjoying the real-time style-transfer demo from NVIDIA.  In addition to the exhibitions, some companies also held interesting after-dinner events, and I could have good discussions on my research with people who are currently working on the companies. In this CVPR, I have learned a lot and had invaluable experience in my life. I really appreciate of UMass CS Women’s help in giving me the financial support for the conference registration! :) "

Sandhya Subramanian has written a wonderful essay on her experiences at ICAPS this year, which we have reproduced in detail below. In June 2017, I had the opportunity to present my paper at the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) 2017. The paper titled “Optimizing Electric Vehicle Charging Through Determinization” was a joint work with Prof. Shlomo Zilberstein and Prof. Prashant Shenoy, and was based on my synthesis project. The conference was held in Carnegie Mellon University. Thanks to the support of CS Women travel grant, I was able to travel to Pittsburgh, PA to present my paper. The conference, including the workshops, was a 5-day event and the attendees were a mix of students, professors, and researchers from the industry. It turned out to be a wonderful experience for me to meet my research community from around the world and share ideas. I was also able to attend several talks and workshop sessions that were part of the conference. It was interesting to hear from many different perspectives and I was able to learn a lot from the speakers at the sessions of workshop and the conference, and from conversations with the other attendees. Almost everyday, there were panel discussions towards the end of the day. The topics for the panel discussion were very interesting and were centered around the various perspectives of future research directions in AI Planning. The panelists were a mix of renowned professors, sharing their views from different an academia perspective, and researchers from the industry, sharing their views from an industry perspective. Here’s a picture of the panel.  The coffee breaks were ideal for casual discussions among the attendees. My interaction with few professors and fellow PhD students during the coffee breaks helped me gain some valuable insights regarding future directions of my current research. Their feedback was very useful and their enthusiasm for my work increased my confidence! Overall, the event was enjoyable and beneficial to me.

Amanda Doucette received $500 to cover the costs of her visit to the Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics workshop. Below is her impression of the event.   As someone who has never been to a research conference before, let alone presented a poster at one, I was excited to attend the Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics workshop at EACL 2017 with the support of the CSWomen Travel Grant. Without it, I wouldn’t have been able to travel to Valencia, Spain to present my undergraduate thesis research. Having never attended a research conference before, I didn’t know what to expect at the conference. I was there to present my undergraduate thesis, “Inherent Biases of Recurrent Neural Networks for Phonological Assimilation and Dissimilation”, which I have been working on with Joe Pater and Brendan O’Connor for the past year. I presented my research at the workshop’s poster session, but I also was able to attend several talks that were a part of the workshop earlier in the day. While most of my research has been in computational phonology, it was exciting to hear from researchers in other areas of cognitive modeling and computational linguistics. The attendees of the workshop were a mix of students, professors, and researchers in both computer science and linguistics, so it was interesting to hear from many different perspectives. I felt like I was able to learn a lot from the speakers at the workshop and from conversations with the other people there. Towards the end of the day, I presented my poster at a poster session that was combined with several other EACL workshops. Because of this, I was able to talk to people with a background in NLP research, rather than in cognitive modeling and linguistics, and was able to have some really useful conversations about my research. It was exciting to be able to finally tell people about what I’ve been working on for the past year, and I’m really glad I was able to meet everyone I talked to at the workshop. I never thought it would be possible for me to present my research at a conference in Spain as an undergraduate student, but thanks to Women for UMass Amherst and CSWomen group, I was able to. The workshop was a really great experience for me, as was spending a few days in Spain!  "

This February, Google organized a Networking Research Summit to engage with academics performing research in various areas of computer networking. My PhD advisor, Dr. Phillipa Gill, was invited to attend the summit to present recent work from our lab, Calipr at UMass Amherst. Google also invited a few PhD students and on my advisor’s nomination I received an invite to attend the Networking Research Summit at Google Mountain View!The summit was a congregation of very well known and accomplished networking researchers. The discussion began with an outline of milestones in the development of Google’s networking infrastructure and the open challenges that they face. This spurred an engaging discussion where academics asked questions and gave ideas to solve the open problems. This style of understanding the practical problems and proposing solutions was the overall theme of the entire summit. In the next two days, the essence of the bleeding edge of networking research was presented to an audience comprising of students, professors and Googlers through a series of talks and panel discussions. Talks by Google engineers and scientists were interspersed among talks by professors from various universities in the world. The coffee breaks offered a great opportunity to meet Googlers who gave us a peek into the kind of problems they work on. I found this perspective unique and thought provoking. Also, being fairly new to the networking research community, I got the chance to interact with many PhD students from other institutions. Google had also organized a poster session for PhD students. I presented our work on PathCache, a network path prediction toolkit. People had great suggestions and feedback for us that we are actively working on. The event was enjoyable and beneficial to me and I hope Google continues to organize it. I am also thankful to Women for UMass Amherst and CSWomen group for providing their generous financial support. It helped cover some of the travel expenses to attend this wonderful event! "

    "body": "2016/11/02 - In this workshop, Alysia Birkholz from the Office of Professional Development talked about how to train our brains for optimism and why it’s important for graduate school success. Tips for Success in Graduate School Show up. Go to class, meetings, and seminars.  Be inquisitive. Ask good questions, often. Contribute in class, meetings, and seminars. Talk to other students and faculty. Read books and papers.  Get to know other people in the department. Talk to people and be friendly. Meet with faculty and make a good impression.  Be proactive. Don’t wait for someone to tell you what to do, ask them what you should be doing.  Train yourself for optimism. This is the focus of this particular workshop. ResiliencePeople who are resilient don’t get there by accident. They prepare to be resilient. Resilient graduate students:  build strong relationships develop optimism practice holistic self care do things that bring purpose to their day, week, or month are proactive and use available resources to thriveNever forget the power of YET. “I am not good at …” represents a fixed mindset. It does not leave room for becoming good at “…”. “I am not good at …, yet. ” represents a growth mind set. It acknowledges that you are not good at “…” right now, but you will become good at it. ANTsANTs are Automatic, Negative Thoughts, or repeated, untrue thoughts that are self-defeating. These thoughts often get in the way, ruin our productivity, and convince us that things are worse than they really are. They are a time suck, because we focus our energy and brain power on them instead of on productive things. The first step to dealing with ANTs is identifying and naming them. Common ANTs with Advisors and Faculty Mind Reading: This is when you assume what someone else is thinking or feeling with very little evidence. For example if you were to pass your advisor in the hallway and they didn’t smile at you and you assume that it’s because they didn’t like an email you sent earlier in the day. In reality, they are probably thinking about any number of things having nothing to do with you.  Personalizing: This is assuming that someone else’s mood or behavior must have something to do with you. For example if your advisor is in a bad mood and you assume it is because they are upset with you. Like us, faculty have many things going on in both their professional and personal lives that have the potential to bother or upset them. More than likely, it has nothing to do with you personally.  Filtering: This is when we choose to only absorb negative feedback even when it is accompanied by even more positive feedback. For example if your advisor tells you that the proposal you wrote is mostly very good, but there are a number of things to work on and you choose to focus on the latter part and think that they must be disappointed in you.  Should Statements: These are unrealistic expectations you put on yourself. For example, “My presentation has to be perfect at every conference I go to. ” Overgeneralization: Coming to a conclusion based on only one data point. i. e. “I didn’t do well on that paper, I’m going to fail out of grad school. ” We must keep in mind that one data point is not statistically significant.  Catastrophizing: This is when we overestimate the chances of disaster. i. e. “If I present at this conference, I’m going to make a fool of myself and my career will be over. ”These are things that we all do all the time and they are completely normal. However, we have to learn how to deal with them when they come up, so that they do not drag us down or hold us back. Challenging the ANTsNotice ANTs in the moment and perhaps even write them down. This will get them out of your head and they will become less intimidating. Provide counter-evidence to disprove the negative thoughts. Question the negative belief in general and ask yourself whether there is actual data to back it up. Look more deeply at what could have caused these thoughts. Think of a way to transform the negative thought into a positive one. For example, instead of saying “I’m not good at …”, say “I’m not good at …, yet, but I will work on it and get better. ” However, sometimes we just don’t feel like we belong here. Impostor SyndromeIn 1978, Pauline Clance and Suzanne Imes coined the term impostor syndrome as a feeling of “phoniness in people who believe that they are not intelligent, capable, or creative despite evidence of high achievement. ” People who experience impostor syndrome tend to be highly successful. They are “highly motivated to achieve” and “live in fear of being ‘found out’ or exposed as frauds. ” Studies have found that 70% of people experience impostor syndrome in their lifetimes. There are different versions of feeling like an impostor:  Diligence: You work hard at preventing people from discovering that you are an impostor, which tends to lead to more praise and success. Thus, leading to a vicious cycle.  Feeling of being a phony: Giving people the answer you think that want to hear. This often leads to feeling like a fake.  Use of Charm: You feel like you are only reacting to social cues to gain approval. You feel like when you are praised it is because you used your charm to get it, not because of your abilities.  Avoiding Display of Confidence: You may feel as though if you believe in your own abilities or intelligence, others will reject or disagree with you. To avoid this, you may convince yourself that you are not intelligent or that you do not deserve the success you have obtained. Like challenging ANTs, challenging impostor syndrome involves reframing your thoughts and feelings. Ways To Reframe Most importantly, accept you had some role in your own success Keep a pride file. Keep things that demonstrate that you did well.  Stop social media comparisons. No one posts about the average, everyday parts of their lives. They only write about the things that are really good or really bad.  Realize that nobody knows what they are doing all of the time Try to help someone else. Similar to a “runner’s high”, helping other people releases dopamine in the brain resulting in a kind of “helper’s high”. You can also retrain your brain by helping people. Train Brain for OptimismTrain your brain to look for good things around you. Make a point, once a week, to identify at least three good things that happened during that week. Practice expressing gratitude for what you have. Write down both positive and negative experiences that you have. This way you can get the negative things out of your head and it will force you to think about the positive things as well. Turn negative thoughts into goals (using “yet”). Finally, Alysia reminds us that “If you’re sitting here today, you belong here today. ” "

    "title": "SMART Goals Workshop",
    "body": "2016/10/19 - This workshop, presented by Alysia Birkholz from the Office of Professional Development, focused on how to set goals and how to stick to them. SMART goalsSMART goals is a goal setting framework originally developed in the business field. It says that goals should be Specific,Measurable, Actionable, Realistic, and Timely.  SpecificGoals should be focused, unambiguous, and defined as much as possible. You should write down exactly what you intend toaccomplish.  MeasurableYou want to be able to tell for sure that you’ve completed a goal. The “finished” state should be unambiguous. Write downconcrete criteria for measuring your progress toward attaining each goal.  Actionable/Action-orientedGoals should be actions that you can take. You should also have a strategy to stay accountable for your goals. For example,telling a friend what you intend to do.  RealisticYour objective should be something that you are both willing and able to accomplish. If you don’t want to accomplish thegoal, chances are you won’t. Each goal should represent substantial progress. You must decide if your goal is attainable givenhow difficult it is to achieve and the amount of time you have to achieve it. Keep n mind any conditions that may be requiredto reach the goal.  TimelyYou should write down when you intend to complete the goal. Keep in mind that it will take about 2. 5 times longer than youthink it will. 9 Factors of Goal Setting Your goals should be something that you really want, not just something that looks or sounds good.  Goals must be consistent with your personal values. If they are inconsistent, you won’t accomplish them.  Your goals must not contradict your other goals, otherwise you will not accomplish either.  You should write all of your goals in a positive sense. This allows you to be more productive in a happier place.  Aim high. Goals should be realistic, but challenging.  Give details for your goals. This goes back to ensuring goals are specific and actionable.  Write down your goals. This allows your brain to work on it in the background, even while you are not focusing on it.  Review your goals and change as necessary. Our lives change all the time and our goals must change with them.  Have goals in all areas of your life. Not just work and school, but in other areas of your life as well. W’s of goal setting Who is involved What is it you are trying to accomplish Where (can be a geographic location or a location in time) When (i. e. timeframe for completion) Which (i. e. requirements or restraints) Why (reasons/purpose/benefits of accomplishing)Long-term vs. Short-termLong term goals can be more vague and should be broken up into smaller, more actionable and specific, short-term goals. Youshould figure out what needs to happen in the short(er) term in order to reach the long term goal. Short-term goals are morelikely to fit into the SMART framework. For example, a long-term goal could be to build your professional network. Short-termgoals toward accomplishing that could be to conduct two informational interviews by the end of the semester, attend threeconferences this year, and join a professional organization. Each of these short-term goals would involve one or more actionsteps and each action step should have a timeframe or deadline associated with it. Final SuggestionsAlysia recommends staying accountable by telling your goals and timelines to a friend and telling them that you will shareresults with them at a particular time.  She also says that it is okay to reset goals, if need be. We don’t always meet ourtimelines the first time. When working towards particular jobs, she recommends choosing at least two job options and worktowards each of them at the same time. This translates to other goals as well: sometimes you may want to choose a backup goaland work contribute to both it and your preferred goal at the same time. For example you may prefer to send your paper to oneconference, but just in case also work toward another conference at the same time, just in case you can’t meet the preferreddeadline. You should also manage your goals, expectations, and time. In another workshop, Alysia talks about how to managetime effectively. "

    "title": "Sofya Vorotnikova Speaks @ Second Lunch",
    "body": "2016/10/11 - Today, CSWomen co-chair, Sofya Vorotnikova, talked abouther research on solving graph problems as well as procrastination, the fear of failure andprocrastination. BioSofya is a third year MS/PhD student at UMass Amherst.  She works with Andrew McGregor in theTheory group. She received her Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics fromUMass in 2014. Her research interests lie in the area of design and analysis of algorithms. She isparticularly interested in processing very large graphs using a small amount of time and space. She is also interested in graph theory, information theory, and communication complexity. Solving Graph Problems in the Streaming ModelSolving graph problems is relevant to many real-world applications. However graphs are often too large to be stored. They can also be distributed across multiple machines and they often change over time. Streaming models for graphs can alleviate these problems. In streaming models, the edgesarrive in a sequence, one at a time. Streaming Models: Insert-only: edges in the stream are only inserted into the graph.  Dynamic: aka insert-delete; edges can be either inserted (i. e. ) into or deleted(i. e. ) from the graph.  Adjacency List: usually we assume edges are in an arbitrary order; in this model edges thatare incident to the same vertex, arrive together; note that in this model, we see every edge twice. Graph ProblemsIn her talk, Sofya covered four common graph problems and her solutions to solving them. Theobjective with all of these problems is to minimize the amount of information stored throughout thestream that is still sufficient to find an approximate solution to the problem. Densest Subgraph: The density of a graph is the ratio between the number of edges to the number of vertices. Thisproblem has a variety of applications including community detection in social networks, identifyingspam links on the web, and applications in finance and biology. Given unlimited access to the graph,the densest subgraph problem can be solved in polynomial time. In Sofya’s work, she shows thatgiven an arbitrary order stream (i. e. insert-only or dynamic), an -approximationwhile storing edges. The main idea for solving this problem is to sample edges uniformly, at random. This works because if a subgraph has small density,after sampling, the subgraph still has a relatively small density. Symmetrically, subgraphs withhigh density also have relatively high density after sampling. ##Vertex Cover and Matching of Small SizeA vertex cover of a graph is a set of vertices such that every edge has at least one endpointin the set. A matching of a graph is a set of edges such that none of the edges share anendpoint with any other edge in the set. The vertex cover problem is finding the minimum vertexcover of the input graph and the matching problem is finding the maximum matching of the inputgraph. Sofya explained these two problems together since they are closely related:. The solution to these problems can be found exactly using space using an arbitrary order stream. Uniform sampling will not work inthis case, because the dense parts of the graph would be oversampled. Instead, vertices arecolored with colors. Then, one edge is sampled uniformly, at random for every color pair. This sampling strategy avoids oversampling high-degree vertices. To solve these problems for a graph, assume .  is defined as the set of heavyvertices with degree at least and is defined as the set of light edges wherethe edges do not have any heavy endpoints. This works, because (with constant probability) if an edge is light, it will be sampled and if avertex is heavy, it’s degree in the graph obtained by sampling colors is at least. Therefore, the degree will be high enough to recognize that the vertex is heavy. ##Approximating Size of Maximum MatchingLess space is required if the goal is only to find the approximate size of a matching rather thanthe matching itself. For this problem, Sofya concentrated only on the class of graphs witharboricity . Arboricity of a graph is the minimum number of forests the graph can bepartitioned into. Subgraphs with vertices of a graph wih arboricity can not havemore than edges. An -approximation can be found using for insert-only streams and fordynamic streams. ##Triangle CountingCounting or approximating the number of triangles in a graph is difficult with arbitrary orderstreaming. Consider a ‘tower’ graph where the graph is made up of triangles that all share a base. (i. e. An outer triangle with several inner triangles with the same base. ) If the base is left outof the sample, we don’t get any of the triangles. This problem is easier to solve with adjacencylists, since every triangle is seen twice. Sofya explained two algorithms to solve this problemusing an insert-only adjacency list stream. In the one-pass algorithm, space is required. In the two-pass algorithm, space is required. #ConclusionSofya concludes by pointing out that streaming models allow both uniform and non-uniform sampling ofedges as well as sampling of vertices. Computing degrees of vertices or other quantities dependingon the degrees also helps with these algorithms, as does using the stream ordering as part of thealgorithm. Personal Talk: What Would You Do If You Weren’t Afraid? Fear of Failure, Procrastination, and PerfectionismSofya explained how procrastination happens using Tim Urban’sInstant Gratification Monkey. In the our minds, the monkey takes over the controls and we start to procrastinate. However,eventually (after look at hundreds of cat videos and checking the refrigerator dozens of timesexpecting something to change), procrastination becomes boring. At this point, shouldn’t workingsatisfy the monkey? It turns out, no. According to Sofya, there is another character in our brainscalled the Fear of Failure Hippo. The hippo makes us think that the possibility of any mistake willlead to catastrophic results. The hippo feeds on perfectionism. When something is not perfect, itcan be interpreted as a failure, which leads to the fear of catastrophe. Sofya has spent most ofher life (17 years) taking classes. She noticed that when taking classes, procrastination is shortterm. Classes are divided into neat chunks and deadlines are hard and close together, so the PanicMonster scares the monkey away often enough to get things done. However, in PhD programs and inresearch, work is not divided into these nice little chunks and deadlines tend to be far away. Themonkey is more prominent in grad school than before and perfectionism is harder, too. Sofya’s mom(who has a PhD) puts it this way: “In research it is not clear when to feel satisfied. ” So whilethe Instant Gratification Monkey is pitted against the Panic Monster, the Fear of Failure Hippo ispitted against Mt. Doom (of unfinished stuff). Eventually the mountain gets so big that we don’tworry so much about failing, and just get it done. Sofya offers no moral, advice, or happy endinghere. Dealing with procrastination is very much a work in progress for everyone. She says that thething to remember here is that we are not alone, because this is a challenge that we all face. "

    "title": "First Lunch of the semester with Susan Landau",
    "body": "2016/09/25 - The first talk of the semester featured Susan Landau. BioSusan Landau works at the intersection of cybersecurity, national security, law, and policy. During the Crypto Wars of the 1990s, her insights on how government encryption policy skewed civilsociety and business needs for security helped win the argument for a relaxation of cryptographicexport controls.  Beginning in the early 2000s, Landau was an early voice in the argument thatlaw-enforcement requirements for embedding surveillance within communications infrastructurescreated long-term national-security risks.  Her position that securing private-sector telecommunications was in the national-security interest ran contrary to public thinking at thetime and deeply influenced policy makers and scholars. Landau’s book Surveillance or Security?The Risks Posed by New Wiretapping Technologies, (MIT Press) won the 2012 Surveillance StudiesBook Prize, while Privacy on the Line: the Politics of Wiretapping and Encryption, co-authoredwith Whitfield Diffie (MIT Press, 1998), won the IEEE-USA Award for Distinguished LiteraryContributions Furthering Public Understanding of the Profession and the McGannon Book Award forSocial and Ethical Relevance in Communication Policy Research. Landau has testified to Congressand frequently briefed US and European policymakers on encryption, surveillance, and cybersecurityissues.  Landau is Professor of Cybersecurity Policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, and haspreviously been a Senior Staff Privacy Analyst at Google, a Distinguished Engineer at SunMicrosystems, and a faculty member at the University of Massachusetts and Wesleyan University. A2015 inductee in the Cybersecurity Hall of Fame and a 2012 Guggenheim fellow, Landau was a 2010-2011 fellow at the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study and the recipient of the 2008 Women ofVision Social Impact Award. She is also a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement ofScience and of the Association for Computing Machinery. She received her BA from Princeton, her MSfrom Cornell, and her PhD from MIT. It’s too complicated: How the Internet Upends Katz, Smith, and Electronics Surveillance LawUnited States communication surveillance law for criminal wire taps as it currently exists is based on two key court cases. The first was Katz v. US, 1967.  Law enforcement had placed a tap on a phone booth in order tocatch people that were placing illegal bets.  The case went all the way to the Supreme Court, whichdecided that the 4th amendment protects people and not places.  This case led to a federalsurveillance law called Reasonable Expectation of Privacy (REP).  The law says that people have anexpectation of privacy even in public areas such as a phone booth, so a warrant is necessary beforelaw enforcement may do audio surveillance in these places. The second case was Smith v. MD, 1979. A woman’s house was robbed and following the robbery, someone (presumably the robber) called her anonymously to torment her about returning to her home. The police got the caller’s phone number from the phone company and put a pen register on it in order to prove that Smith was the caller.  This case also went to the Supreme Court.  It was decided that there was no REP here, because Smith shared his phone number with the phone company and any information shared with a third party has less protection. These two cases distinguish between content and signaling (or dialing) information. Law enforcementneeds to get a wire tap warrant if they want to get content from the subject, but not if they onlywant signaling information. Wire taps only cover the subjects of the tap, so law enforcement haveto minimize recording of non-subjects. Wire tap warrants are also more difficult to get, becauseunlike search warrants, they are not given to people before recording begins. Wire tap law stimiescriminals to an extent by scaring them out of using electronic communication. However, Katz and Smith don’t say much about what to do about IP-based communication. In the 1986 law, content is defined as “any information concerning the substance, purport, or meaning of that communication. ” The 2001 USA Patriot Act replaced references to the telephone with DRAS (Dialing, Routing, Addressing, and Signaling information). #Discerning Content from Non-Content In IP-based communication, the line between content and non-content is less clear than in telephone communication. Take URLs for example. URLs consist of an authority (dialing) and a path(content). So if the URL contains a path such as: www. google. com/maps then it requires a warrant, but if it does not: (www. google. com), then it does not require a warrant. However, www. google. com/maps is equivalent to maps. google. com.  The second URL does not appear to contain a path, so does not require a warrant, even though it is effectively the same as the first URL. #Conclusions Susan and her co-authors determined in their paper that the rules from Katz and Smith are too difficult to apply to modern communication. They came up with three sets of recommendations. ##Guidance for DoJ  Correct 2005 Electronic Surveillance manual Inform judges of the problem Dialing info should be defined as “outside of package” Content should be defined as “inside of package”, even if it contains other packages##Guidance for Judges  Ask about functionality and form of information to be collected with each application Determine whether the DRAS goes through a third party If not, is the technology capable of only collecting the DRAS? If not, determine whether the over-collection involves content or non-DRAS, non-content and whether a Title 3 or Rule 41 search is needed. ##Guidance for Policymakers *The law should be solidly grounded in the reality of today’s technology*Privacy protections should take account of the “Big Data tsunami” Personal TalkSusan was trained as a theoretician. After marrying Neil Immerman, she was part of a two-body problem. She points out that this was in a different time, when it was understood that you never admitted that you were married or part of a two-body problem when applying for jobs. During one of her first faculty jobs, she reported a colleague’s sexist comments to the ombudsman, who responded by telling her that although he didn’t necessarily approve of the other man’s remarks, it was the his personal view and he couldn’t do anything about it. Susan had her children before getting tenure and moved to Massachusetts, where she worked as research faculty at UMass. She mentioned that having senior people say that her work was good helped a lot when things were not going well. In general having senior colleagues that believed in her helped a great deal. Being able to write and speak well and having a lot of grit and determination also helped. She believes that grit really matters and that women in computer science must have a lot of grit to have made it as far as they have.  She thinks that those who finish degrees in computer science are the ones that are determined. "

The Pioneer Valley is a beautiful place filled with many opportunities to get out and enjoy nature. We had 10 women attend, including several students starting this year as well as veterans. After hiking up to the peak of Mt. Norwottuck and taking our group photo (with UMass in the background), we hiked down to see the infamous Horse Caves, and back to the Notch. On the way back to the department, we stopped by Flayvors of Cook Farm to grab ice cream and see the cows.

    "title": "Lunch with Barna Saha",
    "body": "2016/05/17 - The last talk of the semester brought Barna Saha, an Assistant Professor at UMass Amherst College of Information and Computer Sciences. She talked about the Dyck language, the problem of language edit distance, and its relation to other problems. BioBarna Saha is an Assistant Professor in the College of Information and Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She received her PhD from the University of Maryland College Park, and then spent a couple of years at the AT&amp;T Shannon Labs as a senior researcher before joining UMass Amherst in 2014. Her research interests are in algorithm design and analysis, and large scale data analytics. She particularly likes to work on problems that are tied to core applications but have the potentials to lead to beautiful theory. She is the recipient of Google Faculty Award (2016), Yahoo ACE Award (2015), Simons-Berkeley Research Fellowship (2015), NSF CRII Award (2015), Dean’s Dissertation Fellowship (2011), and the best paper award and finalists for best papers at VLDB 2009 and IEEE ICDE 2012 respectively. Playing with Grammars: What Have We Known So Far?Open and close tags that don’t match are one of the largest causes of errors that prevent XML files from compiling. Since files in question are usually too large to debug manually, we need to find an automatic way to correct them. The problem is to insert/delete/substitute open and close tags to transform an erroneous document into a well-formed one. The edit distance is then the number of edits we need to perform and this is the quantity we want to minimize. XML data format can be represented as a Context Free Language. In particular, since the tags have the well-nested property, it is a part of a particular class of formal grammars called the Dyck Language. The Dyck language is a language of well-balanced parenthesis and is formally defined by the following grammar: , , , where is the start symbol, is an open bracket, is a close bracket, and is an empty string. There are a few related problems that concern context free grammars: recognition, string edit distance, and language edit distance. CFG recognitionGiven a grammar and a string, we want to determine whether the string belongs to the grammar. For the Dyck language this problem can be easily solved using a stack: 1234for each bracket in the string:  1. if it is an open bracket: put it on the stack  2. if it is a close bracket:      attempt to match it with the bracket at the top of the stackString edit distanceGiven two strings, we want to find the minimum number of edits to transform one into the other. Language edit distanceGiven a grammar and a string, we want to find the minimum number of edits to change the string into a member of the grammar. This problem is a generalization of string edit distance. Assume that you want to find string edit distance between two strings and . Capitalize the first string, reverse the second, and concatenate them to get a new string . Then the number of edits required to transform into is exactly the same as the number of edits that puts into the Dyck language. In general, language edit distance is significantly harder than string edit distance. The first algorithm for language edit distance is due to Aho and Peterson (1972). It uses dynamic programming and runs in time where is the size of the grammar and is the length of the string. It was then further improved to by Myers in 1985. While the exact complexity of the problem is unknown, it would be very optimistic to hope for a sub-cubic exact algorithm. However, -approximation can be achieved in time, where is the matrix multiplication coefficient. It can be shown that no nontrivial multiplicative approximation ratio can be achieved in time. A few heuristics have been developed for the problem, which work well in practice, but have no performance guarantees. Finding language edit distance for various grammars is a fundamental problem since it is tightly connected to a number of other problems such as matrix multiplication, finding all-pairs shortest paths in graphs, RNA folding, problems in computational linguistics, compiler optimization, etc. Since XML repairing is equivalent to the Dyck language edit distance problem, we are going to concentrate on this class of grammars and design a fast approximation algorithm. The main two results are the following:  -approximation algorithm that uses time where is the optimal edit distance.  -approximation algorithm that uses time where is the approximation factor that can be achieved for string edit distance in linear time. Random Deletion AlgorithmWe start by assuming that the only errors in the string are deletions and present a simple -approximation algorithm. It can be shown that deletions are the hardest to handle and we only lose a factor of 2 in approximation by considering deletions only. The algorithm works as follows: 12345678910111. initialize a stack2. while string is non-empty:  1. if next symbol is an open bracket: put it on the stack  2. if it is a close bracket:    1. attempt to match it with the bracket at the top of the stack    2. if they match: delete both    3. if they don't match:       with probability 1/2 delete the symbol from the string       with probability 1/2 delete the symbol at the top of the stack3. if after going through the entire string the stack is not empty:    delete everything on the stackThis algorithm has two nice properties:  synchronization: at every step the correct move is taken with probability  local repairability: every wrong move can be corrected by two right onesIt can be shown that this algorithm is related to the Gambler’s Ruin problem which is a 1-dimensional random walk and leads to an -approximation. Refinement of Random DeletionTo improve the approximation factor, we introduce the concept of blocks to the random deletion algorithm above. A block is a sequence of open brackets followed by a sequence of close brackets. Note, that we can use string edit distance algorithm on a block. However, splitting a string into blocks exactly is really hard. Thus, we use random deletion algorithm to detect blocks and then run string edit to repair them. This strategy improves the approximation factor to where is the number of blocks. Further RefinementThe problem with the above algorithm is that we can make errors dividing strings into blocks and the errors propagate as the algorithm proceeds. In order to keep those errors local, we can find blocks in parallel instead of sequentially. This makes the algorithm naturally parallel and reduces the approximation factor to .

FOCS 2014 Language Edit Distance &amp; Maximum Likelihood Parsing of Stochastic Grammars: Faster Algorithms &amp; Connection to Fundamental Graph Problems, Barna Saha, FOCS 2015Personal TalkBarna was born in a small town in India. Her mother was a chemistry teacher, and Barna thought she would do chemistry herself. In fact, she only saw a computer for the first time when she was 16. Yet she went to do computer science. In particular, she enjoys design and analysis of algorithms because when you work with algorithms “everything fits together in the end”. Even though not all research is successful (as it usually goes), Barna is really excited about what she does. During her graduate studies Barna struggled with confidence after her Master’s adviser got very upset at her when she made a mistake in her first paper. However, as a PhD student she got a better adviser who helped her build her confidence back up and still maintains a connection with her over email. The main piece of advice Barna gives is to be convident and do things because you enjoy them, not because you have to. "

    "title": "Lockdown lifted, Suspect Caught | Grad Cohort",
    "body": "2016/04/24 - Two days of lockdown in a building full of 551+31+ women - some of them truly inspirational and the rest on their path to be one. This was held in response to a threat to women in computing. These women were briefed about their incredible role as the harbinger of the new era of computing research. All the incidents listed in this report are truly personal anecdotes. No person or organization shall be held responsible. Pardon my language, I have been lately watching a lot of cop thrillers. My experience at this year’s CRAW grad cohort was no less than a thriller; as with every passing session I rediscovered the purpose of my grad studies. As an early career woman with mostly industry experience and now diving into computing research, I had a lot of apprehensions about going against the grain with my research choices. If you are someone who is having one of those “I am not so sure” moments in your research, I say this article and the next grad cohort is for you. Grad cohort is aimed to help graduate students in their early years achieve academic and career success. This year 551 students were sponsored to attend this event in San Diego. The 2 day cohort hosted 31 senior computing researchers and professionals to share their strategies and experiences for a successful career. Each time slot had 3 parallel sessions, catering to students in their first, second and third year separately. Here, I list a brief summary of the sessions I chose to attend. Feel free to contact me (@Shamya Karumbaiah) for the full presentation on all the sessions. The day 1 began with a short alum panel discussion. It was a delight listening to Dr Bushra Anjum (Amazon) talk about her experiences with Impostor Syndrome. I could acknowledge the presence of my own inner critic and the possibility to tame it for my benefit. She also went on to explain how a PhD doesn’t shut the door to industry; but rather keeps the door to academia open. Saeideh Bakshi (Yahoo) spoke about those dark moments in everyone’s PhD and to come in terms with it, keeping a positive attitude. A. J. Brush (Microsoft Research) and America Chambers (University of Puget Sound) facilitated the fun-filled networking session. It is easy to loathe networking if it is perceived as marketing; the key is to make it relational and not transactional. It is also important to realize that networking is not a substitute for quality work. Some easy tips on cultivating these productive relationships were presented and practiced. YY Zhou (UCSD) and Nancy Amato (Texas A&amp;M) presented their zigzag way to find a research topic and demonstrated how one will not be stuck with his/her PhD topic for the rest of life. Also, how spanning two fields is becoming increasingly popular. Moving from coursework to picking a topic is often a low point and it is natural. The best topics are those which intersect your talent, your interest and the social need; chasing hot topics is not always a solution. Many useful tips were listed in the presentation along with the list of 10 places to search for a research topic. This was complemented with the presentation by Rebecca Wright (Rutgers University) which neatly listed tips to find and develop an effective working relationship with your advisor/mentor. It was a delight listening to the Assistant Director of the National Science Foundation (NSF) for the Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Jim Kurose talk about the future of computing. He presented on National Science Foundation (NSF) and elaborated on the computing frontiers. I was especially fascinated hearing about the efforts on ‘CS for all’ - aimed at providing high quality CS education for K to 12. He emphasized the importance of building the CS community to realize all these goals. On the second day, I chose to attend the third year session on PhD academic career paths and job search by Susan Rodger (Duke) and Julia Hirschberg (Columbia). Being new to academic settings, this was highly informative to me. The differences between teaching and research positions were clearly outlined and a systematic approach to climb up the ladder in either case was presented. Susan also spoke about the recent increase in tenure track positions in teaching. My final session was with A. J. Brush and Ming Lin (UNC) on building our professional persona. In addition to the way we present ourselves in a professional setting, the significance of quality control on what is shown as your public profile was highlighted, including updating the many arenas like webpage, github, twitter, digital libraries, etc. To summarize - neatly organized, wisely picked sessions, great speakers, accessible 1:1 advising with mentors, good posters, DJ night/dancing, and of course great food ! Breaks between the sessions were well structured to make the best use of the opportunity to build mentoring relationships. I got most of the reinforcements on my research choice during these casual chats with the senior researchers. It was nice to see UMass Amherst at the forefront with Lori Clarke as a Co-Chair and the enlightening keynote by Jim Kurose. This is written solely from the perspective of a first year graduate student trying to solidify her research goals. The beauty of grad cohort is that you have a good mix of sessions to specially cater to your needs. The rule of thumb is to dump your personal devices in the room and take the utmost advantage of these two days.  "

    "body": "2016/04/21 -  As part of the WW2A mentoring program, a mentors’ retreat was held at the Willits-Hallowell conference center at Mount Holyoke College. The retreat started with some breakfast and coffee at 9:30AM. The Assistant Director for the Center for Teaching &amp; Faculty Development, Brian Baldi facilitated the mentor training. In the three hour session, Brian conducted different activities to emphasize on the practices towards effective mentoring. The training was highly appreciated by the participants. Post lunch, there was an open discussion with the mentors – coordinated by the WW2A mentoring program committe (Emma Strubell, John Foley and Shamya Karumbaiah). Since this is the first year running a mentoring program of this sort, the suggestions from the mentors were highly useful. The WW2A mentoring program committee will consider these comments in formulating the program better.  The mentoring program will formally begin on June 1 with the introductions of the mentor-mentee pairs. With a goal of fostering cross cultural ties, this mentoring program will embark upon a new form of mentorship.

    "body": "2016/04/01 - One of our members, Shiri Dori-Hacohen, has been successful in being awarded the Grace Hopper scholarship to attend GHC multiple times in the past. As a result, she often fields questions about the admissions process. This year, she has taken the time to compile them into a list of “frequently-asked-questions” for members working on their application or attending for the first time.   On top of the GHC16 scholarship applications, there is also a call for proposals with the same deadline (March 30th). Proposals include panels, talks and posters. From my experience, people with accepted posters often have a higher chance of getting scholarships. There are technical and non-technical tracks.  http://ghc. anitaborg. org/2016-speakers/  This is a very cool opportunity if you’re interested in public speaking or presenting your research in a non-traditional setting. (If the latter is your goal, be mindful that this is not considered a technical publication and should probably not be used to communicate otherwise unpublished research. If in doubt, consult with your advisor).  Also as an added perk, accepted talks (but not posters) are getting a complimentary registration for the day of your talk, or a discount if attending the entire conference.  I’m passing this along with a blog post with tips on how to maximize your chances for a proposal to be accepted:  https://www. linkedin. com/pulse/proposing-talk-grace-hopper-read-tips-first-karen-catlin  Best of luck to all,Shiri How do I keep an eye out for announcements?: Sign up for their newsletter or follow them on your favorite social media (look for icons on the top &amp; bottom) General Application Questions: I am a first year graduate student at UMass Computer Science. I want to apply for Grace-hopper scholarship, what is your advice?: My biggest piece of advice would be to submit a poster in addition to the scholarship application. Getting a poster presentation accepted is correlated with scholarships. How does reimbursement work?: You get reimbursed later. Do I need a travel authorization?: Yes, you must fill out a Travel Authorization form, which lays out your expected travel, housing, and meal expenses for UMass ahead of time. If I get accepted, what about registration?: This varies from year to year, but often runs out early. Keep an eye out for announcements. What about other funding sources?: Google scholarships or other sources have been available in the past. You’ll have to see what becomes available this year. GHC should know about it; keep an eye out. I missed the deadline, what can I do?: There’s always next year. If you’re an early-stage grad student, you will also be eligible for Grad Cohort, so keeep your eyes open for emails about that as well. Is it a good idea to bring my husband/spouse/significant other with me?: While family travel is not likely to be supported through grants, your family is certainly welcome at the conference. I (Shiri) have attended with a baby and a husband, but it’s your personal choice. What about childcare?: There is usually free childcare, but you have to sign up in advance. If you then don’t attend the conference, they will charge you money anyway. What are the deadlines?: The website is the one true source. Should I also apply to the department GCH award?: Yes. You definitely should apply once details are out. If you’re not sure if they’re out, ask our Khaleesi, Leeanne. What should I write my essay about?: The topic might change from year to year, but assuming it stays similar to prior years, there are some general pointers. Typically, they ask “Why do you want to come, and how will you share back with your community?” You should:  Focus on topics like your specific challenges.  Answer how attending GHC will help you, specifically.  Answer how you’ll share what you learn back to the CS women community (You can always write a blog post!).  Make it personal, use stories from your life. How do I get someone to proofread my essay?: If you have time, it’s best to get someone else to read and review your essay (preferably a native English speaker, if possible). Sign in to cswomen. slack. com and ask for feedback! Student Research Competition Authorship: There appears to be a department limit for the number of submissions that can be sent from each department. GHC recommends coordinating with your chair. : This doesn’t appear to be relevant to our current year, or they’ve removed the submission page. Either way, our current chair is James Allan, who would coordinate submissions. In the future, if you want to apply to this, and you don’t know who the chair is, you can always email womenchairs@cs. umass. edu, and someone will help you. I can’t submit to this because I always work with my advisor, right?: As long as work is done primarily by you, it can be submitted. What this means is dependent. If you’re not sure, ask your advisor. You should check with your advisor about submitting any of this work, anyway. "

    "body": "2016/02/26 - The first lunch of the Spring 2016 semester happened on February 10. After introductions and group news, we had a discussion of the roles of male allies in CS Women, the goals of the group, what it means to its members, and how we can better serve the community. The following is based on the opinions voiced during the discussion. Introducing new officers: Graduate co-chair: John Foley Treasurer: Emma Tosch PR chair: Su Lin Blodgett Diversity chair: Shamya Karumbaiah GWIS liaison: Amee Trivedi Graphic designer: Sophia Berger Webmaster: Ishita Dasgupta Scribe: Sofya VorotnikovaGroup news: Last semester the group became a Graduate Student Organization, which allows us to get funding from the university in addition to funding from the department.  Recently we launched a new website and blog. Feel free to contribute a blog post! Weekly hack/office hours/hangout. Currently held every Friday 4-5pm in CS303. Stop by to ask any questions you have to co-chairs or just hang out.  CSWomen has been awarded a Welcoming the World to Amherst grant by the Student Engagement and International Programs Office. This grant will be used to sponsor a mentoring program that will help new students with the transition to graduate school. Each mentor will be assigned two students, one domestic and one international, to create bonds between current and new students as well as domestic and international ones. In order to fulfill the task best, mentors will receive training from the program. For more information see this blog post.  Last semester the group started a new initiative: supplying women’s restrooms in the CS building with feminine hygiene products. Shaylyn Adams volunteered to stock the supplies and obtain funding from the faculty. Goals of CS Women group: Providing support for women in computing.  Changing the perception of women in computing, both in the department and in the community at large.  Helping its members connect with other women, since it is often hard to do in a male-dominated environment.  Letting members draw pride from involvement in the group. Role of male allies, reaching out: Having a male co-chair can help the group reach out to the community, attract more interest, and improve the image of the group. It brings new perspectives and opportunities.  The group should organize a few publicity events to educate members of the community about the challenges that women in computing face and the goals of the group in trying to overcome those challenges.  In addition to publicity events, the group should organize social events where everyone (not just women) is invited.  At the same time, many members expressed interest in women-only events, in particular monthly lunches.  Ask men about their perspective and ways in which they are willing to be included. Ask current allies how they got involved and what are some useful strategies for involving more people.  For more information on the role and involvement of male allies, see this extensive survey. Other suggestions: More social events Cultural potluck and/or cultural movie night Events on public speaking Having some time at lunch events set aside for people to speak up and ask questions Joint game night with Women in Math groupIf you have any comments, suggestions, or recommendations, please email womenchairs@cs. umass. edu, talk to one of the co-chairs, or stop by CS303 on Fridays 4-5pm.

Our proposal “ZeppelinBend: A Peer Mentoring Program for Fostering Intellectual Ties and Academic Success in Graduate Computer Science” was a group effort led by CSWomen members Shamya Karumbaiah and Amee Trivedi, and supported by co-chairs Emma Tosch and Emma Strubell. A general planning meeting for this grant will be held on Tuesday, February 2nd at 4PM, open to all CSWomen members. The text of that proposal is presented below:  Birds of a feather flock together. This concept is known as homophily and is true even with the students who have left their home country to pursue their dreams in a foreign land. Homophily can be comforting, especially in the beginning when everything is new. But as all students progress in their academic program, it becomes essential for students to break free of this safety net and collaborate with people outside their culture; this is all the more true when it comes to a demanding graduate program in a competitive field of study like computer science. Trying to build new relationships becomes increasingly difficult as students progress in their program. Consequently, embracing cultural diversity from the start will not only aid students’ success in the program but also enhance their overall experience and morale during their years in graduate school. We propose kickstarting a new peer mentoring program designed to match pairs of incoming graduate students with a current graduate student in STEM at Umass. Named after the knot that combines two distinct pieces of rope, traditionally used for mooring airships, it encapsulates the program we are proposing.  The project will be launched in three phases:    Mentor training for current graduate students, recruiter from the participating GSOs.   Initial pilot of the proposed “buddy triangles” with incoming graduate students in the College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS).   Compilation and dissemination of our preliminary results to other STEM departments.   We propose to use this grant in the spring semester to train our mentors for this project, and to send them to social cultural events. To facilitate a smooth execution of this project, the mentors will receive cultural awareness training and effective mentoring training. The trainings will be held in conjunction with a retreat off-campus, at the Willits-Hallowell center at Mt. Holyoke College. CS Women has held a teacher’s training and retreat there for their Technical Workshop Series and found it to be highly effective at creating a bond between student-teachers. The CS Women leadership feels that this training will be invaluable for retention of mentors in the program.  Some social events we propose include sending students to Holi, a cultural event organized by one of our collaborating organizations, the Indian Student Association(ISA). ISA has a history of drawing diverse students to their events; in Fall 2015, the ISA Diwali event hosted 260 students, of which 40% of the students were non-Indians. Many of the current students were introduced to the culture of India. We have also been in touch with Iranian, Korean, and Chinese student cultural groups about their events.  In addition to events that showcase individual cultures, we also propose an intercultural event, organized around 4F’s : Food, Flags, Fun, Facts. We propose an informal event where people from different cultures come together and get to know each other while expanding their knowledge and making new professional connections as well. We will feature food from students’ cultural backgrounds; shared activities such as music and dancing; and moderated discussions about issues pertaining to culture shock. We intend to organize this larger event in conjunction with Graduate Women in STEM (GWiS), and connect it with their mentoring workshops, ethical issues workshops, culture shocks and handling workshops, and research collaboration mixers.  The above describes how we intend to use the funds during the Spring semester. However, the mentoring program will not stop in the Spring. We would like to connect it up with our plans for a new mentoring program that will begin in Summer 2016 and conclude over the 2016-2017 academic year. This second part of the proposal describes the lasting impact the first part will have at UMass.  To facilitate interaction between domestic and international students, we will assign “buddy triangles. ” These triangles consist of an incoming international graduate student, an incoming domestic graduate student, and one current graduate student. When assigning triangles, we will consider program type (MS/PhD), research focus, gender and cultural diversity, etc.  The interactions between the 3 buddies will begin with a welcome mail from the mentor. The incoming students, especially the international students will need support even before they arrive. Support could be anything ranging from advice on academic issues, such as course selection, advisors, research topics, or labs, to practical issues such as housing, weather, or healthcare. Mentoring activities will begin by early August. We are currently working with the College of Information and Computer Sciences to plan and execute events such as a welcome social and a potluck to display students’ cultures. While the current graduate student would be an anchor for the two incoming students, the pair of the incoming domestic and international students would also build a relationship to support each other and build a network to help them succeed.  We will run this part of the project in CICS, since it is the home of CS Women, and since over 50% of each incoming CICS graduate class are international students. Computer Science is the largest single-subject academic department at UMass, having over 250 graduate students. Once we have completed this second phase of the project, we will write up our experiences and share them with other departments.  There are several benefits of this project in addition to the improved interactions between the international and domestic students. The current students serving as mentors will benefit from this cultural awareness when they serve in leadership positions, such as teaching assistants. We believe this program will also improve the retention of the incoming culturally diverse students and will have a cascading effect as participants transition into professional leadership roles in academia and industry. Their experiences in this program will better prepare them to work with individuals of all cultures and better serve in their mentoring and teaching roles. "

    "title": "Lunch with Jennifer Williams",
    "body": "2016/01/01 - On Wednesday, December 16, invited speaker Jennifer Williams, of MIT Lincoln Labs, gave a talk on her work on cross-language summarization and her experience as a first generation college student. Finding Good Enough: A Task-Based Evaluation of Query Biased Summarization for Cross Language Information RetrievalA large portion of Internet content is not in English. In fact, 70% of all Internet users are non-English speakers. News, blogs, tons of data in foreign languages. How do we understand what is happening around the web in languages other than English? How do we help users exlore all this data if they don’t know the language it is in? The problem at hand is the following: given a large data set in a foreign language and a query in English, we want to produce a summary of the query result in English. This task requires a number of techniques used in natural language processing: machine translation, cross-language search, and summarization. The algorithm often used to summarize the results of a query is LexRank, which is a modified version of PageRank algorithm adapted for NLP purposes. Sentences in the documents of the given data set are represented as vertices in a graph. Edges represent similarity between sentenses. From that the algorithm ranks vertices by how similar they are to the query and how cental they are to the documents. Top-ranked sentenses are then returned as the summary. There are several approaches for closing the language gap between the query and the data set. Jennifer Williams tested three of them on a large data set in Farsi:  Translate the query from English to Farsi, search the data and summarize search results in Farsi, then translate the summary back to English.  Translate the documents from Farsi to English, search and summarize the results in English.  Use the two methods above and combine the results. To evaluate the results, human relevance prediction was used: showing people a query and a summary and asking if the summary is relevant. As it turned out, the joint approach was superior, followed by translating the entire data set to English, followed by translating the quesry and searching in Farsi. One possible explanation might be the loss of accuracy when translating the query. Since queries are generally short, every word matters, and translating even one incorrectly can lead to huge accuracy losses. However, the problem with the other two approaches is that they require translation of the entire data set (which can be massive) to English. As the main future work direction Jennifer Williams names developing golden standards for full-scale evaluation. If such standards were set, we could then apply intrinsic metrics, potentially improving evaluation process. Personal Talk: First Jen-erationJennifer Williams comes from a small town in Oregon called Central Point. She is a first generation college student: her parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles didn’t go to college. Thus, she had to carve her own way, getting out of her home town, seeing the world, and having a career despite all the roadblocks she had on her way. When she was younger, Jennifer’s dream was to become an astronaut. She enjoyed welding, construction, and working on cars. In high school, she worked as an assistant electrical engineer and even gave a presentation at NASA headquarters during her junior year. In 2003, Jennifer went to college majoring in engineering and physics. However, soon she had to drop out due to a major car accident. While recovering, she opened herself to subjects that she didn’t have much interest in before, such as history, politics, philosophy, and social issues. She read a lot and wanted to study how human brain worked. This got her interested in artificial intelligence and natural language processing. And after returning back to college, she graduated with a degree in applied linguistics. Graduate school brought a number of stories, both fortunate and unfortunate. She spent eight days driving from Oregon to DC and there had to rent a closet with no windows for 895 dollars a month plus utilities. During her second year, she lost two grandparents one month apart. She moved to Virginia and rented a living room for two years, where she was separated from the rest of the house by just curtains. She missed her best friend’s wedding despite being friends with her for 23 years. At the age of 27, she left United States for the first time in her life, got to publish six top-tier papers in two years, and traveled the world. Some of her friends’ and colleagues’ advice and encouragement stuck with her during those rocky times:  Don’t try to fit a mold.  Live in a space where the problems are hard.  Doing what makes you happy is the most rewarding direction to pursue.  Truth flourishes best in places of light and cooperation. Bio Jennifer Williams joined the Human Language Technology Group at MIT Lincoln Laboratory in 2012 as an associate technical staff member. Prior to joining the Laboratory, she held a position as visiting researcher in the Human Language Technology Department at the Institute for Infocomm Research in Singapore, where she developed a novel approach to discourse processing for real time speech-to-speech machine translation. Before she began her research in HLT and natural language processing, she worked across several of the engineering disciplines including electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, and physics. She holds degrees in Applied Linguistics (B. A. , 2009, magna cum laude) from Portland State University, and Computational Linguistics (M. S. , 2012) from Georgetown University. "

    "body": "2015/12/08 - On Wednesday, November 18, invited speaker Consuelo Valdes gave a talk on her experience with design and user experience research and on the importance of soft skills. 21 members attended: 5 undergraduate students and 16 graduate students. Bio: Consuelo Valdes is a user experience designer currently working in cyber-security. After graduating Wellesley College in 2011 with a B. A. in Media Arts &amp; Sciences, she became a research fellow at the Wellesley College Human-Computer Interaction lab. Since transitioning to industry in 2013, Consuelo has worked as a UX designer in healthcare security and cyber-security. Throughout her professional career, Consuelo has designed and built tabletop interfaces, mobile apps, holographic interfaces, and automagical interfaces. Research Talk: HCI/UX: Museum to Malware: Human-computer interaction (HCI) and user experience (UX) lie at the intersection of psychology, design, and computer science. Consuelo Valdes has worked as a UX designer on multiple projects during her time in the industry, some of them are described below.  ARTeMuse: a museum guide app engaging students with works of art. Novice museum visitors are often unfamiliar with art concepts and lack the skills for interpreting works of art. The app provides advice on what to look for in a particular piece and how to engage with it, which makes the experience more enjoyable and less intimidating. Using ARTeMuse increased the average time a student interacts with a work of art from 30 seconds to 3 minutes.  Green Touch: project created to ease collaborative data collection and analisys by biology students. The project consists of three parts: mobile interface for easy data collection and recording, web application allowing data storage in the cloud, and table-sized multi-touch surface interface for data visualisation and analisys.  Imprivata OneSign: healthcare security application allowing healthcare providers to log into workstations and applications in a fast and secure manner. Doctors have to log in up to 70 times a day which is time consuming and often frustrating. OneSign provides a system that allowes quicker access to information they need. Currently, Consuelo Valdes works at CloudLock on cyber-security. Personal Talk: On the Importance of Soft Skills: While soft skills are crucial for a successful career, they are often undervalued. Consuelo Valdes discusses soft skills that everyone needs.  Stay positive: it might not be always easy, but it is important to maintain a positive outlook in professional situations.  Check your ego: focus on your own work and don’t pay attention to what other people are thinking.  Be friendly.  Be a team player: take initiative and help members of your team when needed. "

    "title": "Second Lunch with Researcher Jinying Chen",
    "body": "2015/11/10 - The second talk of the semester brough Research Scientist Jinying Chen from UMass Medical. 26 members attended: 2 faculty members, 4 undergraduates, and 20 graduate students. Research talkThe Application of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning to Clinical NotesThe field of Natural Language Processing deals with translating between structured data that is easy to manipulate, such as databases, and informal unstructured data such as written or spoken human language. The problem of converting structured data to unstructured is called Natural Language Generation and can be viewed as “robots talking to people”. The other direction is Natural Language Understanding, letting machines understand human language. NLU deals with problems of information extraction and retrieval, answering questions posed in natural language, summarizing texts, etc. Particular examples include: summarizing a webpage for a database entry, letting a search engine understand a complex query instead of just keywords in it, searching and classifying reviews of a product to devise the general opinion of the public, building dialog systems that allow human-computer communication, machine translation, and spam detection. The particular project Jinying Chen has been working on at UMass Medical School is Clinical Notes Aid. Its goal is to help patients understand electronic medical records. Such records are readily available, but are often hard to understand due to specific terminology used by medical professionals. The goal of the project is to develop a system that simplifies those notes and makes them more accessible for patients. It improves communication between health providers and patients by automatically identifying and replacing medical jargon with lay language or linking terms that might be unfamiliar to patients to definitions and educational materials. The first step of building such a system is mining medical jargon from electronic health notes and assessing the importance and familiarity of each term. Considering these two dimensions instead of just importance improves the performance of the system, since most important terms are not necessarily most unfamiliar to the users. Based of these two parameters the system creates a ranking of terms to determine what to show the patient first. Next step involves devising synonyms and definitions for these terms. In order to do that, inter-wiki links on Wikipedia are used to come up with suitable candidates. For example, phrase “increased thirst” in one article might be a link to “polydipsia” page, thus the two will be considered synonym candidates. Unfortunately, not all candidates are actually accurate and human curation is required at this step. After the relevance of each synonym or definition is verified, it can be used to annotate health records. The reverse of this problem has also been considered: translating lay language to medical terms. This allows patients to search for information related to their conditions even if the don’t know the exact terms to use in their queries. These is a possibility of combining the two projects in the future, thus making both of them more effective. Other future directions include creating personalized translations of jargon suited to fit the needs of particular patients, simplifying health records by summarizing them, and taking word disambiguation into account for better translations. Personal talkExperiences in Working in Industry in Computer ScienceDecision between academic and industry research career paths can be a tough one. Academic and industry positions are quite different and have specific advantages and disadvantages. When choosing, it is important to keep in mind that moving from academia to industry can be easier than vice versa. In this talk Jinying Chen concentrates on describing working in the industry as a researcher. The main characteristic of industry is that it is very product oriented. Your research must be related to the product and you don’t get to do much independent work. Some companies do not allow their researchers to publish their results due to confidentiality issues. Some even have policies that forbid you to work and publish on similar problems even after you leave the company. Another consequence of being product oriented is that industry requires fast results and gives you less time to work on each problem. While in academia you can take months or even years to work on a project, in the industry some progress has to be shown every couple of weeks. At the same time, industry positions can provide more stability than academia, since you are not required to obtain outside funding to do your work and your career does not depend on getting or not getting tenure. If you decided to be a researcher in the industry, Jinying Chen provides you with some advice:  Ask questions about the company and your position at the job interview. Which projects will you work on? Are they relevant to your current research? Will you utilize your experience at its fullest? Will you be allowed to publish your results? Seek information from outside sources. Do an internet search about the company or ask current employees for their opinions.  Once you started working, find a mentor or join a team. This way you will catch up on things faster.  Find friends at your workplace. They can let you know about any unofficial rules of the company.  Advertise your work.  Be ready for fast work pace.  Prepare for the future. Have mid-term and long-term goals, keep self-motivated, and keep learning. Bio Jinying Chen is a senior research scientist/post-doc researcher in the Department of Quantitative Health Sciences at UMass Medical School. Before joining UMMS, she was a research scientist at Raytheon BBN Technologies. She received her PhD and MS degrees from the Computer and Information Science Department at the University of Pennsylvania in 2006 and 2001, respectively. Her research focuses on algorithms and models for biomedical information extraction by leveraging natural language processing and machine learning technologies. Her previous research projects include word sense disambiguation, information extraction, machine translation, and image document analysis. "

    "title": "Grace Hopper Celebration Experiences: Part II",
    "body": "2015/11/08 - The CS Women Co-Chairs have asked participants who attended the 2015 Grace Hopper Celebration to tell us about their experiences. We have collected their responses and are making a series of blog posts about them.  In this post, Yamin Tun describes her experience. Yamin was sponsored by CICS and Yahoo! Which sessions did you attend? Mastering the Technical Interview Fun with Machine Learning (Tech Node) - by Microsoft (Jennifer Marsman, Lauren Tran, Sheila Tejada) Wireless Network Systems for Monitoring Human Health - Suryadip Chakraborty (University of Cincinnati) Career Fair (Wed-Thurs) Wed Afternoon Plenary - Clara Shih, Blake Irving, Megan Smith Thurs Afternoon Plenary - Sheryl Sandberg, Nora DenzelWhat part of GHC did you find most helpful?I found the workshop (Mastering the Technical Interview) one of the most helpful sessions.  I found technical interview to be the most nerve-wracking experience of job searching since the decision of hiring is based mostly on such interviews. I got a chance to ask questions on how to prepare and perform in technical interviews to a female engineer at Palantir. She also encouraged us to apply for jobs without feeling constrained and discouraged from job listing requirements. She shared her experience that she didn’t apply for one of her dream jobs just because she lacks one job requirement in the job listing, while male tends to apply for jobs even if only 60% of his qualifications match with job listing. Did you feel especially inspired or empowered by any of the sessions?I find inspiring and empowering, especially Sheryl Sandberg’s talk and Clara Shih’s talk. Clara Shih, CEO and co-founder of Hearsay Social, has shared her experience that most women faced in male-dominant tech industry. It was during a tech conference when 7 different men asked her to get a glass of water or show the direction of restroom when she was while she was “one of these guys. ” The way she handled such shocking experience showed a good representation of women and even made her build a strong networking bound with those men who apologized her later in the conference. Another inspiring session is Sheryl Sandberg’s talk. Sheryl opened her talk with shocking fact about women’s involvement in current industry: “The numbers for women in leadership aren’t moving and the numbers for women in tech aren’t moving,” Sandberg said on Thursday. As Sheryl said, women tend to think of their own flaws and get hindered by family commitment, resulting to shy away from their ambitions while men continues seeking for opportunities with less burden of society’s expectation and family commitment. Sheryl’s talk made me realize that such low statistics of female in tech and leadership is all due to a cycle between stereotypes on women and actual little involvement of women in tech and leadership positions. Low number of women in current tech industry creates society’s expectation of women to be soft-spoken housewives or secretaries rather than vocal technicians or engineers who build things. Such expectations further affects women’s thinking, resulting for fewer women to shy away from leadership and tech positions, which results in fewer women in important roles in today’s society. Sheryl said that despite the huge amount of effort of multiple organizations encouraging female involvement, as long as this cycle exists, the number for women in tech and leadership will still remains unchanged. As Sheryl suggested, the only way to break this cycle as a female is to start “leaning in” and build up confidence to go against deep-grained stereotypes of females. This inspires me to be more confident and more daring and seek more opportunities with a different mindset. Which companies did you talk to? Cisco Facebook Google IBM HP Twitter Amazon Intel Disney Textio ebay Box AppleAre there any ideas/events/etc. that you would like to see CS Women do as a result of this event?Setting up a club named “Lean In” circle under CS Women would be a good idea. [I would also like to see] more discussion forums/workshops on topics like imposter syndrome, how to adjust as a female student in male-dominant classrooms, how to get back to academia or tech industry for married women, and other common issues that women face. Did you interview with any companies at GHC?I had interviewed with two companies: Cisco and Textio. I want to share interview experience with Cisco. I have interviewed with Cisco’s Internet-of-things Team (IoT). I had a great conversation with one of the Distinguished Cisco IoT engineers, who did PhD at UMass Amherst in 1994. I heard from the engineer about what Cisco is doing with Big Data from billions of devices to make machine smart and autonomous. I had a chance to share my background and research interest in machine learning and computer vision. I got advice from him not just as an interviewer, but as a UMass alumnus. He gave me suggestions on making choices between doing PhD and working in industry and career choices. In addition, I got to know many other female engineers from Cisco IoT team. One of the great experiences was when I got to sit next to a female product manager from Cisco team during Cisco dinner. She gave me a lifetime advice on networking, how I should behave as one of the few women in male-dominant tech meetings, and asked me to keep in touch with her. "

    "title": "Grace Hopper Celebration Experiences: Part I",
    "body": "2015/10/26 - In past years, CS Women has held a lunch after the annual Grace Hopper Celebration​ for students who have attended to share their experiences. Since GHC is now well-known, we are retiring this practice and are instead asking those who went to tell us a bit about their experience for a blog post, so that new students can benefit from their experiences. Rose Tharail John has written a wonderful essay on her experiences at GHC this year, which we have reproduced in full below. ​Firstly I must thank the CICS and our sponsors - Yahoo, for giving us the opportunity to be a part of such a huge gathering. It was my first time at GHC and I must say - it was a truly amazing experience. It was overwhelming to see so much energy and enthusiasm in a 12000 odd crowd, all gathered to promote one thing we all believe in - women in technology. It went to prove how much we can actually improve the world around us just by working together and sharing ideas. I wish I could attend all the sessions they were offering; for which I had to invent time travel! The ones I attended were extremely informative and encouraging. I especially liked the Microsoft’s “Fun with Machine Learning” tech node. The session was thoughtfully developed - touching upon basics and moving on to giving a general idea on more advanced ML concepts with fun real life examples. Their use of Azure ML to drive home the concept was effective and at the end of the session most of us, left a little wiser on Machine Learning. In the first day’s plenary, Clara Shih CEO and Founder of Hearsay Social shared with us her wisdom of how she navigated and won in a Man’s World. Her thoughts on the subject were meaningful and I believe is something all of us women, who aspire to break the ice must follow - do not overreact by being offensive, rather let the men know that you too are one among them in a subtle but effective manner. This can help go a long way and bridge many useful relationships for the future. The career fair had a plethora of companies and I realized on Day 1 that it would not be possible for me to talk to everyone even if I tried to. I could sense the energy among students and recruiters. I appreciated the fact that every single person I talked to, took time to review my resume, ask me questions and gauge my fit for their teams and also explain what they were working on. I happened to meet so many passionate and accomplished women who are now guiding teams or divisions of their own. The cherry on the cake for me, came in the form of Intel offering me a Full time opportunity to join their Cloud Platform team. I would love it, if we as a group could host a mini Grace Hopper every year. Given that we have so many colleges near us and that UMass CICS has such excellent credentials, I only felt it was appropriate for us to host something similar and open our doors to female coding community in the five colleges area. It would be a great opportunity for us all to share our experiences and grow in our knowledge. "

In this new data-producing and data-sharing world, most data is not curated and data origin and derivation are often obscured.  Yet, now more than ever, applications are heavily data-driven and important decisions are made based on data (e. g. , what infrastructure should the government invest in, or who gets a mortgage).  In this talk, I will discuss new evolving needs of data analysis, including providing explanations and facilitating data understanding, and diagnosing problems in data. Anticipating, avoiding, and sometimes embracing our failuresFailure is a normal part of life and of academia.  More often than not, what we consider failures are not dreadful disasters, but rather, missed opportunities.  I will talk about my own experiences with failure, the opportunities I missed, in particular during my graduate career, and the lessons I learned.

    "body": "2015/10/13 - For the second year in a row, we ran a very successful Ice Cream Social! This year it was on Friday, September 18th. 34 members attended in total, with 19 graduate students, 13 undergraduate students, one staff member, and one faculty member. A variety of cold desserts were served. We also used this event to introduce our newest CS Women Co-Chairs: Emma Strubell and Supriya Kankure. Emma and Supriya will serve two-semester terms, from Fall 2015–Spring 2015. Other general announcements included our status on becoming a Graduate Student Organization. As of today, we have been accepted as a GSO (1). However, we are still working on the organizational structure. If you have any suggestions, please take a look at our constitution on GitHub and leave comments there! Unfortunately, we were not able to get pictures this year! If you attended and have pictures to send us, to attach to this post, please contact one of our Social Media Chairs: Nabanita De or Diane Tam. (1) Note: There seems to have been a clerical error in the processing of our organization’s name – we are currently working to remove “Graduate” from the group name, since this group is open to all affiliates of CICS.

    "body": "2015/04/21 - Today we were thrilled to host Bobby Simidcheiva (PhD ‘15) and Vicky Manfredi (PhD ‘09) from Raytheon BBN! They gave a presentation about their work with BBN and held an open Q&amp;A with students after the event. Raytheon BBN kindly sponsored this lunch. In addition two our two guests and a recruiter, 16 graduate students, 2 undergraduates, and one staff member attended. After the event ended, some of the students who attended graciously stepped outside for a photo in the wind: AbstractHave you been wondering about what life is like after school? We are here to help. We are two recent PhD computer science graduates from UMass Amherst now working as researchers at Raytheon BBN Technologies. In this talk, we will give you some background about BBN, share with you how we found jobs there, describe what working at BBN is like, and answer your questions about networking for jobs and transitioning to a non-academic environment. Raytheon BBN Technologies has been providing advanced technology research and development for over 60 years. From the ARPANET, to the first email, to the first stereo digital mammography system, through the first metro network protected by quantum cryptography, BBN has consistently transitioned advanced research to produce innovative, practical technology solutions for our customers. Today, BBN’s innovations allow for ubiquitous networking and speech understanding in any language or format. BBN scientists and engineers continue to take risks and challenge conventions to create new and fundamentally better solutions. BiosVicky Manfredi is Network Scientist at BBN Technologies. Her current work focuses on designing efficient and secure communication protocols for ad hoc and heterogeneous networks. She also works on problems at the frontier between computer networks and machine learning. Her prior work has looked at the trade-off between incurring some cost (such as control packets or energy) to obtain updated information about the network as conditions change, versus the utility of that information for informing behavior. Vicky received a Ph. D and an M. S. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, and a B. A. in Computer Science and Neuroscience from Smith College. Prior to BBN, Vicky was a Computing Innovation Fellow at Boston University. Bobby Simidchieva is a research scientist in the the Distributed Systems group at BBN. Since joining BBN last year, she has primarily been working on quantifying and characterizing cyber security risks. Through modeling distributed systems and the defenses available for deployment, as well as the various attacks that adversaries could execute, we can predict what attacks are feasible and attach metrics such as cost and security to different defenses. In previous work, Bobby has worked on the modeling and analysis of complex human-intensive systems. Her dissertation focused on the explicit specification of variation in families of human-intensive systems to make their modeling more precise and facilitate their subsequent analysis. She recently completed her Ph. D. in Computer Science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst and holds dual B. S. degrees in computer science and computational science from the State University of New York, College at Brockport. "

    "body": "2015/04/02 - Oh, what a belated blog post! On Tuesday, March 10th, Prof. Audrey St. John (UMass PhD ‘08) gave a two-part talk on her research in rigidity theory (a branch of computational geometry) and running a research program with undergraduates. 17 members attended, including 13 graduate students, 2 undergraduate students, one faculty member and one staff member. Rigidity Theory for Robotics, Drug Design and CAD When designing a bridge, how can we minimize the amount of building materials while maintaining stability? Are there computational tools that can help predict protein flexibility, a key component in drug design? Rigidity theory seeks to answer these questions by studying structural properties from mathematical and computational perspectives. In this talk, I will discuss the fundamental questions considered by rigidity theory and its applications, including those in robotics, structural biology and Computer Aided Design for mechanical engineers. Searching for a Career PathA career path is exactly that: a path (and not a shortest path!). Search and traversal of it is a lot like what you learn about in Algorithms and AI: you’re discovering new nodes and edges, and you’re trying to define the function to optimize. I’ll talk about my own pathway to my current position, the choices I’ve made and why I would make them again. #BioAudrey St. John is an Associate Professor of Computer Science at Mount Holyoke College. Her research is motivated by computational challenges arising in robotics, biology and Computer Aided Design; in 2013, she received a Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award from the National Science Foundation (NSF). St. John earned a B. A. in Computer Science and Mathematics from Wellesley College (Summa Cum Laude, Honors in CS), followed by an M. S. and Ph. D. in Computer Science from UMass Amherst (her graduate work was partially supported by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship). "

Queripidia - Query-specific Wikipedia ConstructionAbstract: We all turn towards Wikipedia with questions we want to know more about, but eventually find ourselves on the limit of its coverage. Instead of providing “ten blue links”, my goal is to answer any web query with something that looks and feels like Wikipedia. I am developing algorithms to automatically retrieve, extract, and compile a knowledge resource for a given web query. For a very early web demo with some example queries see: http://ciir. cs. umass. edu/~dietz/queripidia/ Build a Shrine to YourselfAbstract: Am I good enough? Is this the right topic? Am I in the right place? Am I passionate enough? If I switch now, will my career be over? - I have a lot of self doubts. I went through several advisors, topics, and research labs before I graduated age 34. Maybe I did everything wrong. Yet, some people believe that I am a successful researcher. How did I trick people? This is a talk about how to build a shrine to yourself. #Bio Laura Dietz is a post-doctoral researcher / research scientist working with Bruce Croft at the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) at the University of Massachusetts. Before that she was working with Andrew McCallum. She obtained her doctoral degree with a thesis on topic models for networked data from Max Planck Institute for Informatik in early 2011, being supervised by Tobias Scheffer and Gerhard Weikum.  Between Masters and PhD, she worked at a Fraunhofer Institute until it got shut down. She worked on her PhD in Darmstadt, Berlin, Saarbruecken, Cambridge (UK), and Amherst. "

    "title": "Lunch with Jennifer Chayes",
    "body": "2014/11/24 -  Our second CS Women group lunch had Jennifer Chayes, a head of Microsoft Research in New England and NYC, who was visiting UMass as a DLS speaker. It was funny as we were casually talking to Jennifer in the beginning, one of our students asked, “So do you work in MSR?” and she said, “Well, I run it. :) “ Needless to say that she was a wonderful woman who was nice, friendly, charismatic and inspiring, we had a lot of fruitful discussions that even led our usual lunch time running longer than the usual. I will try to recap the discussions we had today. Stereotype Threat: Whistling VivaldiAs Shiri brought up one of the sessions provided at GHC that was about stereotype threat, Jennifer introduced one interesting story called ‘Whistling Vivaldi’ from a book that she recently read. It was a story about this guy named Claude Steele, who was an African-American student at University of Chicago. He noticed that every time he walks by the street, he realized that other people viewed him as some other outsider that they should be afraid of, rather than as one of them. He thought about what he can do to make them view him as the same member of the community, he started whistling Vivaldi’s music whenever he walks around, and it worked. People who heard the whistle stopped viewing him differently. Then what can we do to deal with such stereotype threats in our cases? What would be our “Vivaldi Whistling” as minority women in mathematics and technology? Jennifer also explained to us that in the book, the author asserted that in order to reduce the negative effects of stereotype, a mentor/advisor/boss’s role is also very important. His advisor viewed him as a capable and competent individual rather than a minority black student, and that helped him feel secure and confident, which essentially led him to show better performance. This sounded like a message that can be useful for faculty too. I personally have the best advisor I can ever ask for, so I completely understood what the author meant by that. #Satya’s Mistake At GHC We also talked about what happened to Satya, the Microsoft CEO, at GHC. He recently had a lot of criticism by saying that it’s better not to ask for raise for a better karma for a question that how women should ask for raise. There were so many news articles that spotlight his rather careless remark and when the heat went up, there were people who asserted that Satya should resign. Microsoft’s stock dropped 6% that day. Jennifer said that given that he apologized immediately later, it looked like an innocent mistake, that he was probably thinking about the time back then he didn’t ask for his raise. But most importantly, she expressed her worries that because of his slip and harsh criticism that follows, this would make other males afraid and shy about coming to places like GHC and speak. Because people go home changed at places like GHC. It’s very different than reading about these issues at home but seeing, talking, and interacting with these women and listening to the real problems. We want more males to come to GHC and go home changed, and it’s truly important to have male allies to make changes together. We Need Male Allies!The discussion shifted to the importance of having male allies. It’s so much easier to make changes if they spoke for women too. In her case, her husband Christian Borgs, who is also a managing director of MSR New England and sincerely cares about these issues, helped making many changes to hire more women researcher in the center. So instead of treating other male workers as “enemies” who probably act upon an implicit biases rather than malicious intentions, helping them to see the problems and incorporating them as our allies is a very important issue.

Student, Emma Tosch, won a Best Paper award at OOPSLA 2014, for her work on “Surveyman,” a first-of-its-kind software system for designing, deploying and automatically debugging surveys to improve their accuracy and trustworthiness. This is a huge honor especially given that OOPSLA is one of the top-tier conferences in the programming language research field! Her Surveyman work also won first place at the PLDI Student Research Competition. Tosch’s advisor, professor Emery Berger, says, “Poor quality data can be seriously misleading. Flaws in survey design and deployment threaten the validity of results, making them untrustworthy. Until now, there has been no way to address these shortcomings automatically. But Surveyman, which is a free, publicly available and revolutionary new tool, can identify problems in any survey from the design stage onward. It should completely change the way people create surveys. ” "
