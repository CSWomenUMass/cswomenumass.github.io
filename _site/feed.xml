The 33rd edition has gathered 13,000 attendees, with a program covering all subfields of AI. The conference is so large that attendee tickets are assigned via a lottery. As a first-year PhD student, I entered the lottery with little hope, but to my surprise, I won a ticket and complimentary registration. Thanks to the CS Women Group travel funds, I have been able to catch this opportunity and attend the conference. My personal goal was to get to know NeurIPS and keep up-to-date about the main research directions in machine learning this year. Here are a few highlights from my week at NeurIPS 2019 in Vancouver, BC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few thematic lines emerged from the conference. The problem of the limitations of deep neural networks, and in particular, generalization, has been recurrent. As pointed out by Yoshua Bengio in his talk, out-of-distribution generalization is still a missing piece of the puzzle for deep learning to reach the status of human-level AI. From the current state of deep learning, we need to shift to a framework in which high-level representations and causal discovery are possible. Other limitations of the current state of Machine Learning are in its social implications. For example, privacy is becoming an increasing concern in today’s machine learning scene: on-device inference and federated learning are emerging as a way to train machine learning models on user data while keeping information decentralized (and private).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NeurIPS is a great opportunity for in-depth exploration of specific research topics. In my case, I especially followed the privacy-related talks. Differential privacy (my current field of research) has gained momentum and I had the opportunity to connect with many researchers presenting their work in this field. This has been useful for me to inscribe my research work in a larger perspective. I got a sense of what directions differential privacy is taking and how it is being applied to various problems. NeurIPS can also be experienced as a breadth-wise expo of pretty much all machine learning research branches. I enjoyed exploring a variety of research topics that are not yet part of my work and wish to study in the future. Among these, causal inference, which is also gaining momentum, both in academic and industry research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even with prior knowledge on its importance, NeurIPS still had a big wow effect on me the first day I arrived. 13,000 attendees, 1,428 accepted papers, 51 workshops. With so much going on, and so many people, I admit it has been an overwhelming experience at first. On day 1, I attended all morning sessions, tried to stop at every poster (that was of course impossible!), and sat at all afternoon sessions. By the end of the day, I felt overloaded with information and burned out. My advice for first-timers at NeurIPS is to tailor a personalized agenda, balancing your own field of research and other areas. Then let go of the frustration of missing out on all the rest – when I did, I started enjoying the conference way more! I really enjoyed the social aspects of NeurIPS: networking with other researchers from around the globe has been a fun experience, as well as attending company networking events. In particular, I had a great time at the Google Women in Research reception, where I had the chance to connect with fellow women researchers at different stages in their careers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Attending NeurIPS 2019 has been an enriching experience and I am looking forward to attending future editions. I wish to thank the CSWomen Travel Grant Committee for awarding me travel funding that has contributed to covering my trip expenses to the conference.&lt;/p&gt;

At the poster session, I presented my research work on ‘Learning 3D Priors with Adversarial Novel-View Generation’, a project I had been pursuing at UMass with professor Subhransu Maji and Matheus Gadelha. This was my first time attending an academic conference and presenting my work outside the university setting. Getting to discuss my ideas and results with a wider audience was very rewarding. The poster session was a great exercise in communicating my ideas with people from varying backgrounds. I’m grateful for all the encouraging feedback and insightful suggestions I received during the session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the poster sessions were the main highlight of the event for me, WiML’s entire program was packed with learning opportunities. Thanks to mentorship roundtables, we got the chance to talk with brilliant scientists such as Yan LeCun and Hugo Larochelle. The tables featured a variety of topics from research to career at giants such as Apple and Google, to practical lessons on work-life balance and much more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, it was a wonderful experience, and I’d encourage others to present their work at WiML. It’s a great way to meet accomplished researchers and get feedback on your ongoing projects.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>linglonglinglong</name></author><summary type="html">Thanks to CS Women and Women for UMass, I attended the Women in Machine Learning workshop held in Vancouver, Canada, on December 9th.

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the conference, I had several exciting conversations with fellow researchers about
their work as well as my own. I was introduced to so much research I had no idea was going on
(including some stuff I’ve briefly thought about before and wondered if anyone was working on
it!) I discovered numerous papers that I look forward to reading after speaking to their authors.
Overall, it was great to spend the week with machine learning researchers from all over the
world who are very passionate and driven about their work. It was very inspiring and the
conference left me with a new excitement toward my work. Thank you for the opportunity CS

Thanks to CS Women and Women for UMass, I was able to attend CVPR 2019, a top-tier computer vision conference, located in Long Beach, California! I had the privilege of presenting my research at the conference in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/fgvc6/home&quot;&gt;6th Fine-grained Visual Categorization workshop&lt;/a&gt;. Introducing my research in a spotlight talk in front of hundreds of people was an empowering experience, and a great opportunity for me to practice my public speaking skills.&lt;/p&gt;

The summer school focused on preparing students for PL research by introducing and teaching core PL concepts, discussing possible future research areas, and connecting attendees with both new and experienced colleagues in their field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each day consisted of four lectures, with topics ranging from a review of the implications of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pliss2019.github.io/ben_titzer_spectre_slides.pdf&quot;&gt;Spectre&lt;/a&gt; to an introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;http://plasma-umass.org/pliss2019/&quot;&gt;first-class continuations&lt;/a&gt; and many of the topics being completely new to me. Students were encouraged to actively participate and ask questions, and several of the lectures turned into interactive sessions with the speaker. This was one of the things that I really appreciated about PLISS - the atmosphere felt very welcoming and it was clear that the speakers’ goal was student comprehension. PLISS fostered a great learning environment, and I left with more questions than I arrived with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the lectures, another focus of the summer school was connecting the students with others in their field, and PLISS offered us many opportunities to socialize and talk science. It was fun to hear about what projects the other students were working on and I got some good feedback about my own project. Moreover, it was reassuring to meet researchers in the same stage of their careers that I am in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much thanks to the CS Women’s group for their support in subsidizing my trip! I highly recommend PLISS, or another summer school in your field, I had an awesome time!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;In early November, I went to attend AMIA (American Medical Informatics Association) 2017 Annual Symposium at Washington D.C. The conference is about informatics for improving health and making better healthcare decisions, basically in five domains of informatics: translational bioinformatics, clinical research informatics, clinical informatics, consumer health informatics, and public health informatics. I went to present my paper of using natural language processing method for data mining in Electronic Health Records. I am very happy that people showed interest on my work and asked me questions, and I also got valuable insights from them for future work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the keynote presentations, various talks, poster sessions and workshops, AMIA also offers rich networking opportunities, like AMIA New Member and First Time Attendee Reception, Women in AMIA Networking Event, AMIA dancing party etc. It’s great to talk with researchers working in different aspects of medical informatics and to learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, it’s a wonderful and very rewarding experience for me. I am very thankful to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.umass.edu/wfum/&quot;&gt;Women for UMass Amherst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cswomenumass.github.io/index.html&quot;&gt;CSWomen group&lt;/a&gt; for providing the generous financial support, which help covered part of the travel expenses.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>kritishrivastava</name></author><summary type="html">In early November, I went to attend AMIA (American Medical Informatics Association) 2017 Annual Symposium at Washington D.C.
