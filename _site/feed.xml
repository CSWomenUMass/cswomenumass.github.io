&lt;p&gt;The interesting part of this conference was the diverse attendees and companies who gathered from all around the world: Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland, Austria, UK, Canada, States, Japan, China, and etc. The environment of the conference was also very dynamic and energetic as each of these popular eye tracking companies had their own stations, and attendees could freely test their newest devices and talk with them about state-of-the-art products. This vibrant connection between academia and industry was really unique, fun to participate, and educative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am really grateful to the CSWomen group for providing the financial support. It helped me cover some of the expenses to participate in this great event.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>linglonglinglong</name></author><summary type="html">In the last week of June 2019, I had the opportunity to present two of my projects, titled “iLid: eyewear solution for low-power fatigue and drowsiness monitoring” and “W!NCE: eyewear solution for upper face action units monitoring”, at the ACM symposium on Eye Tracking Research and Applications (ETRA) in Denver, Colorado.

Thanks to CS Women and Women for UMass, I was able to attend CVPR 2019, a top-tier computer vision conference, located in Long Beach, California! I had the privilege of presenting my research at the conference in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/fgvc6/home&quot;&gt;6th Fine-grained Visual Categorization workshop&lt;/a&gt;. Introducing my research in a spotlight talk in front of hundreds of people was an empowering experience, and a great opportunity for me to practice my public speaking skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/travel-timm-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Convention Center&quot; style=&quot;margin: 15px 10px 10px 0; height=600px; width=600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people attended the conference from academia and industry alike, all congregating together with the common goal of furthering the advancement of computer vision. I had the chance to network with many professors and fellow graduate students whose research I’ve been following. I also got the chance to talk with industry professionals about how their companies use computer vision and machine learning to improve user experiences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/travel-timm-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Long Beach Convention Center&quot; style=&quot;margin: 15px 10px 10px 0; height=600px; width=600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve greatly enjoyed this opportunity to learn more about my area of research, share my work with others, and network with the computer vision community this summer in Long Beach!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge thank you to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.umass.edu/wfum/&quot;&gt;Women for UMass Amherst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cswomenumass.github.io/index.html&quot;&gt;CS Women&lt;/a&gt; for supporting my research aspirations by helping fund my trip to CVPR!&lt;/p&gt;

The summer school focused on preparing students for PL research by introducing and teaching core PL concepts, discussing possible future research areas, and connecting attendees with both new and experienced colleagues in their field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each day consisted of four lectures, with topics ranging from a review of the implications of &lt;a href=&quot;https://pliss2019.github.io/ben_titzer_spectre_slides.pdf&quot;&gt;Spectre&lt;/a&gt; to an introduction to &lt;a href=&quot;http://plasma-umass.org/pliss2019/&quot;&gt;first-class continuations&lt;/a&gt; and many of the topics being completely new to me. Students were encouraged to actively participate and ask questions, and several of the lectures turned into interactive sessions with the speaker. This was one of the things that I really appreciated about PLISS - the atmosphere felt very welcoming and it was clear that the speakers’ goal was student comprehension. PLISS fostered a great learning environment, and I left with more questions than I arrived with!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to the lectures, another focus of the summer school was connecting the students with others in their field, and PLISS offered us many opportunities to socialize and talk science. It was fun to hear about what projects the other students were working on and I got some good feedback about my own project. Moreover, it was reassuring to meet researchers in the same stage of their careers that I am in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much thanks to the CS Women’s group for their support in subsidizing my trip! I highly recommend PLISS, or another summer school in your field, I had an awesome time!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;In early November, I went to attend AMIA (American Medical Informatics Association) 2017 Annual Symposium at Washington D.C. The conference is about informatics for improving health and making better healthcare decisions, basically in five domains of informatics: translational bioinformatics, clinical research informatics, clinical informatics, consumer health informatics, and public health informatics. I went to present my paper of using natural language processing method for data mining in Electronic Health Records. I am very happy that people showed interest on my work and asked me questions, and I also got valuable insights from them for future work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the keynote presentations, various talks, poster sessions and workshops, AMIA also offers rich networking opportunities, like AMIA New Member and First Time Attendee Reception, Women in AMIA Networking Event, AMIA dancing party etc. It’s great to talk with researchers working in different aspects of medical informatics and to learn from them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As my summer of 2017 came to a close, I had the fortune of attending a &lt;a href=&quot;https://cit-ec.de/en/graduate-school/summerschool&quot;&gt;week-long summer school program on Cognitive Architectures&lt;/a&gt; at Universität Bielefeld Cluster of Excellence Cognitive Interaction Technology (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cit-ec.de/en&quot;&gt;CITEC&lt;/a&gt;) in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/travel-liu-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liu-Cognitive Architecture Banner&quot; style=&quot;margin: 15px 10px 10px 0; height=600px; width=600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Days were filled with keynote talks on cognitive architectures geared towards applications in robotics from senior researchers who are well-known in their research areas. In the afternoon, we split into subgroups where each group was assigned a robotic platform and a task to complete by the end of the week. I was assigned to Pepper, a humanoid robot from SoftBank Robotics, with the task of having it learn how to play the cup-and-ball game. While the task was rather disconnected from the cognitive architecture theme we saw during the keynote talks, it was still fun and interesting to work with a different robotic platform than what I normally use in my lab.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/travel-liu-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Liu - Pepper robot&quot; style=&quot;margin: 15px 10px 10px 0; height=600px; width=600px&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part of this whole experience was the unique networking opportunity. CITEC Summer School drew in around 30 young researchers from not only robotics, but also psychology, biology, linguistics, and other subfields of computer science. The majority of the participants were from European research institutions (I was the only from the U.S.). As such I was able to discuss my research interest and bounce ideas off of people both inside and outside the robotics community as well as promote the ongoing work of the robotics community at UMass Amherst. The relatively small and diverse attendance was definitely unique to the summer school and something you would not normally get to experience from larger, more field-targeted conferences.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you so much &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.umass.edu/wfum/&quot;&gt;Women for UMass Amherst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cswomenumass.github.io/index.html&quot;&gt;CS Women&lt;/a&gt; for providing the financial support to subsidize a portion of this trip!&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;Hawaii is a really great place for summer vacation, but I have experienced something different this summer by attending a conference there! It is IEEE/CVF computer vision and pattern recognition (CVPR) which is one of the top-tier conferences in the computer vision community. Thanks to CS Women, I could attend this year’s CVPR and present my workshop paper at &lt;a href=&quot;https://sites.google.com/view/fgvc4/home&quot;&gt;Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC)&lt;/a&gt;. My work is to group faces in a movie without any supervision, which can cluster the same person with a unique ID. In the poster session, I introduced my proposed work and showed a demo video. I discussed my work with many people and got a lot of valuable comments. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/travel-jin-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SouYoung at her poster presentation&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During the main conference, as there are enormous amount of papers, I had to use my time efficiently. So, everyday I woke up in the morning, I went through all the papers in the list and read some abstracts to check which oral/poster presentations I would like to visit. Then, I read the papers more deeply or visited the corresponding posters to talk with authors at the spot, which is the best part of attending a conference!! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This CVPR had around 200 sponsors from industry, and there were many interesting exhibition booths. Here is a photo of me enjoying the real-time style-transfer demo from NVIDIA. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/images/blog/travel-jin-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;SouYoung at Nvidia's style-transfer demo&quot; /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to the exhibitions, some companies also held interesting after-dinner events, and I could have good discussions on my research with people who are currently working on the companies. In this CVPR, I have learned a lot and had invaluable experience in my life. I really appreciate of UMass CS Women’s help in giving me the financial support for the conference registration! :) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Sandhya Subramanian has written a wonderful essay on her experiences at ICAPS this year, which we have reproduced in detail below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In June 2017, I had the opportunity to present my paper at the International Conference on Automated Planning and Scheduling (ICAPS) 2017. The paper titled “Optimizing Electric Vehicle Charging Through Determinization” was a joint work with Prof. Shlomo Zilberstein and Prof. Prashant Shenoy, and was based on my synthesis project. The conference was held in Carnegie Mellon University. Thanks to the support of CS Women travel grant, I was able to travel to Pittsburgh, PA to present my paper.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference, including the workshops, was a 5-day event and the attendees were a mix of students, professors, and researchers from the industry. It turned out to be a wonderful experience for me to meet my research community from around the world and share ideas. I was also able to attend several talks and workshop sessions that were part of the conference. It was interesting to hear from many different perspectives and I was able to learn a lot from the speakers at the sessions of workshop and the conference, and from conversations with the other attendees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Almost everyday, there were panel discussions towards the end of the day. The topics for the panel discussion were very interesting and were centered around the various perspectives of future research directions in AI Planning. The panelists were a mix of renowned professors, sharing their views from different an academia perspective, and researchers from the industry, sharing their views from an industry perspective. Here’s a picture of the panel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The coffee breaks were ideal for casual discussions among the attendees. My interaction with few professors and fellow PhD students during the coffee breaks helped me gain some valuable insights regarding future directions of my current research. Their feedback was very useful and their enthusiasm for my work increased my confidence!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, the event was enjoyable and beneficial to me. I am thankful to Women for UMass Amherst and CSWomen group for providing their generous financial support.

Thanks to the support of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.umass.edu/wfum/&quot;&gt;Women for UMass Amherst&lt;/a&gt;, we have awarded another &lt;a href=&quot;http://cswomenumass.github.io/travelgrant.html&quot;&gt;Travel Grant&lt;/a&gt;! Amanda Doucette received $500 to cover the costs of her visit to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cmcl2017.osu.edu/&quot;&gt;Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics workshop&lt;/a&gt;. Below is her impression of the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;As someone who has never been to a research conference before, let alone presented a poster at one, I was excited to attend the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cmcl2017.osu.edu/&quot;&gt;Cognitive Modeling and Computational Linguistics workshop&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href=&quot;http://eacl2017.org/&quot;&gt;EACL 2017&lt;/a&gt; with the support of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://cswomenumass.github.io/travelgrant.html&quot;&gt;CSWomen Travel Grant&lt;/a&gt;. Without it, I wouldn’t have been able to travel to Valencia, Spain to present my undergraduate thesis research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Having never attended a research conference before, I didn’t know what to expect at the conference. I was there to present my undergraduate thesis, “Inherent Biases of Recurrent Neural Networks for Phonological Assimilation and Dissimilation”, which I have been working on with &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogs.umass.edu/pater/&quot;&gt;Joe Pater&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://brenocon.com/&quot;&gt;Brendan O’Connor&lt;/a&gt; for the past year. I presented my research at the workshop’s poster session, but I also was able to attend several talks that were a part of the workshop earlier in the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While most of my research has been in computational phonology, it was exciting to hear from researchers in other areas of cognitive modeling and computational linguistics. The attendees of the workshop were a mix of students, professors, and researchers in both computer science and linguistics, so it was interesting to hear from many different perspectives. I felt like I was able to learn a lot from the speakers at the workshop and from conversations with the other people there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Towards the end of the day, I presented my poster at a poster session that was combined with several other EACL workshops. Because of this, I was able to talk to people with a background in NLP research, rather than in cognitive modeling and linguistics, and was able to have some really useful conversations about my research. It was exciting to be able to finally tell people about what I’ve been working on for the past year, and I’m really glad I was able to meet everyone I talked to at the workshop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I never thought it would be possible for me to present my research at a conference in Spain as an undergraduate student, but thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.umass.edu/wfum/&quot;&gt;Women for UMass Amherst&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://cswomenumass.github.io/index.html&quot;&gt;CSWomen group&lt;/a&gt;, I was able to. The workshop was a really great experience for me, as was spending a few days in Spain!&lt;/p&gt;
