# WW2A Mentorship Program
The first days of a graduate program can be both exciting and challenging. Successful students often cite having a diverse support group of friends and family.
This fall, CSWomen will launch a mentorship program for incoming students, where we will pair domestic and international students with a current graduate student as a mentor. 
Following are the list of volunteering mentors:
